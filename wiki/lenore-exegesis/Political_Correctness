Hypothesis: [[Lenore]]'s theory explains "politically correct" speech codes and intolerance and the like as [[Introverted Intuition]] gone wild, trying to move into the [[extraverted]] arena as a basis of social agreement--where it can't possibly work.

= Neutrality über alles =

[[Introverted intuition]] leads you to seek a point of view outside any system, from which to make judgements about that system and see aspects of the system that can't be seen on its own terms.  In particular, it leads you to seek a ''neutral'' perspective: one from which you can render judgements without bias, especially hidden bias.

A particular form of bias that many [[INJs]] especially loathe is the bias that comes from your economic situation: your social class, or who's buttering your bread.  If you're from an economically well-off social class, it can be very convenient to believe that you and your friends are better off than the poor people across town because you're smarter, have more drive, better moral character, or some other innate trait that makes you come off looking good and ''deserving'' your privileged position.  There are winking conspiracies, where people play along with a social myth like "we're the most charitable," lest they be kicked out of their group and lose all the attendant benefits.  These convenient myths are never put to a real test, because the unwritten social rules prevent any such test from ever occurring.  Instead, there is the ever-present false test: "See, we're better off and we look nicer.  If they were better people, they'd be better off, too."

[[Introverted intuition]] used for [[ego orientation]] leads one to take responsibility for the unintended consequences of decisions and the hidden factors that lurk behind public façades.  The felt responsibility is to ensure that all decisions take all these hidden factors into account.

This goes too far when the rule becomes, "Make no decision until the criteria for making it are certain to be without any form of bias whatsoever."  This cannot be done.  When raised to the level of a moral principle meant to bind a society, it simply nullifies all social agreements and offers nothing to put in their place.  It turns the fact that you are a living being, eager as any living being to turn things to your advantage and flourish in the world, into a source of shame.

If you are successful in any way, using your talents and social connections as any person must in order to flourish, this is proof of your guilt.  It's not enough to achieve, you are only allowed to achieve if you can prove that you did it without any special advantage that someone else did not possess.  Even judging something as an achievement reflects bias: other people, raised differently, might not agree that designing semiconductors is a worthy achievement; they might instead value break dancing.  Who are you to say that yours is better--or more worthy of funding?

The extremes of political correctness come about when every public act that in some way uses or establishes power--which is to say, every public act--is viewed as something that must be put down by force lest it establish an unequal power relationship.  So, for example, complimenting a woman on her appearance must be stopped, because it establishes that women's role is to be sex objects, a role that the woman might not agree to.  Even if the particular woman enjoys it, this is no reason to allow the behavior: her enjoyment of being complimented might not be a truly free and informed choice, growing out of a lifetime of seeing that women in this role receive material benefits; the woman might not know of any alternative.

The philosophy of [[John Rawls]] would be the ultimate ''reduction ad absurdum'' of [[introverted intuition]] as a basis of social contract.

It's easy to see how ''anything'' can be construed the same way.  Isn't it unfair, for example, that so many street signs in the United States are written in English?  What about people who are not fluent in English?  Don't they get a say?  Doesn't the use of English say implicitly that we as a society think that European civilization, with its Latin alphabet and SVO grammars, are superior to all others--and that non-Europeans are therefore second-class citizens?  Doesn't the use of money implicitly dub a left-brain, numerical style of thought superior to the right-brain styles still in use among many South American tribes?  Doesn't the institution of property itself unfairly favor just one kind of human social organization among many?  Aren't we able to do these things--only because we ''can?''

Inferior Se could also be leading [[INJs]] to make snap judgments based on surface appearances, then use their Ni to backwards-rationalize them.  If looks like discrimination, then it must somehow be discrimination, simple as that! The INJ tertiary function could tempt them into believing the Se "fact," and use their Ni to dig up up someone's biases to prove it. This may be an example of how the [[Tertiary Temptation]] manifests for [[INJs]].

How it might work for [[INTJs]]:

* ''Ni + tertiary Fi + inferior Se :'' "See that boss complimenting his female employee? He is sexist, because it's just obvious; end of story. I bet all his power has gone to his head and is making him feel all macho. We all know know that power corrupts, and that's the vibe I'm getting from him. There is no way in the world that his motives are pure."

* ''Ni + mature Te:'' "How they feel about each other is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is whether we can establish some objective criteria to determine whether he is actually sexist or not. Until I can, I would have no way to know that I wouldn't be revealing my own biases if I assumed that he was sexist."

For [[INFJs]]:

* ''Ni + tertiary Ti + inferior Se :'' "See that boss complimenting his female employee on her appearance? He is sexist, because it's just obvious; end of story. It makes sense that a boss is going to treat be a chauvinist pig towards a female subordinate anyway.  That is just how hierarchies work."

* ''Ni + mature Fe:''' "Regardless of his motives, his compliment raises her standing in the community.  Sure, he could be a chauvinist pig, but I don't want to make such an assumption because the compliment might be the way the boss and employee relate to one another. Maybe he is just being a nice guy. If the woman is happy being defined by a feminine role, then that is a legitimate way for her to place her stakes in the community. Her motives for desiring that role aren't relevant as long as she is happy with it, because everyone has to find a role that works for them."

Mature secondary Fe and Te would realize that [[political correctness]] disrupts the community and doesn't allow any kind of objective criteria for evaluating people. For instance, politically correct speech codes in certain workplace environments can lead males to avoid all interaction with female co-workers out of fear of saying something that could be misconstrued as harassment, or establish buddy systems so that nobody is alone with an unscrupulous female who might be believed by default if she invented an excuse to point a finger.  Ironically, situations like this can result in females not getting promoted because they cannot develop social connections with the males who may be evaluating their skills. From the standpoint of mature Te, such speech codes are idiotically inefficient and subjective. From the standpoint of Fe, they are repugnant because they lead to more unfairness.

Ironically, one of the first groups of people I hear condemning [[political correctness]] is [[INJs]], who claim that it is impractical and biased!

''More Lenore:'' "The defensive nature of these efforts is apparent in the laws, charters, hymn books, and classroom agendas that issue from them.  The language of these products is not inclusive so much as disembodied. Made to accomodate the INJ's purely conceptual approach to life, the terms don't support every point of view; they reflect no one's actual experience."

Thus, it is probable that  political correctness occurs when [[INJs]] enslave their [[secondary function]] to their [[dominant function]].  This is an analogous to an INTP using his Ne only to brainstorm all the possible ways people are dysfunctional and clueless. If [[INTPs]] were in charge, stupidity would be a much worse crime that bias.

Out-of-control Ni supported by immature secondary Fe and Te might make an INJ obsessed with classifying people as racist/sexist/whateverist, or devising tests to "prove" the INJ's suspicions of bias. Ni combined with immature Fe leads to "you are either with us, or against us" thinking such as the common mantra, "if you aren't part of the solution, then you are part of the problem." To avoid the hypocrisy of their own rhetoric, they will find ways to "prove" that their own accomplishments were not garnered through privilege (Te). Or they might join a group of other people who like to point fingers and claim that their membership means they are "unbiased" (Fe). This leads to logic like "It's impossible for me to be racist because I'm a minority! It's my job to do the finger-pointing here!" However, mature Fe and Te would realize that [[political correctness]] disrupts the community and doesn't allow any kind of practical criteria for evaluating people,  and that extreme Ni rhetoric leads to hypocrisy when turned in on itself. For instance, politically correct speech codes in certain workplace environments can lead males to avoid all interaction with female co-workers out of fear of saying something that could be misconstrued as harassment, or establish buddy systems so that nobody is alone with an unscrupulous female who might be believed by default if she invented an excuse to point a finger.
