Hi, Robert.  Thank you for posting your thoughts to my wiki!

I took the liberty of creating a home page for you, since I hadn't written [[How to Participate Here]] until this morning (26-Oct-2004).

I'm confused by some, well, pretty much all, of what you've posted so far.  No doubt that's inherent in this subject: it takes a while to find a common vocabulary.  One quick question to start off, just to get the site's home page cleaned up: do you mean something by "Then it's up to the reader to judge whether a particular judgement is right or wrong!!!" that isn't expressed in the preceding sentence?  (That's what I intended the preceding sentence to mean, anyway.)  Or are you objecting to the wiki policy of refraining from making official pronouncements of what the correct interpretation of [[Lenore]]'s stuff is?

I'm attempting to illustrate the difference in cognitive process between we two.  I have difficulty expressing myself with ideas that are not arguments.  All dominate Tis do (though they can to an extent, as I've shown with my pages of definitions).

I also find it difficult to slow down when an idea has gripped me.  I lay out the arguments in the first flush of discovery, then go back and modify or retract them.  Like extroverted intuitives, it is not uncommon for me to leave after a short while.  I have already spent more time here than I have in other places, though it's quite possible I'll return in a few months/years.

Your [[How to Participate Here]] is an example of Je assigned law.  An agreed framework of how to cooperate.  Those who extrovert perception can adapt themselves to this a certain extent, but it involves a significant internal sacrifice on our parts.

Robert, are you there?  Can we talk by email?  I'm thinking that it looks like you have an important idea to contribute here, but it's scattered all over the wiki to the point of being virtually incomprehensible.  How about creating a new page and assembling your argument there, including stating what you're arguing for?  Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding you--it's hard to tell right now.  --[[Ben Kovitz]]
