spends a long time trying to lay a guilt trip on his friend and be
excused for not showing up at a wedding, all of which seems
unequivocally Fe.  But the language in which he expresses all this
and makes his case is that of faithfulness to The Prisoner, a cause
that he sees as trumping conventional ways of expressing
relationship and even calling for redefining them, no matter what
the cost in friendship.  As I understand Lenore, that's the classic Ji
pattern.  He describes The Prisoner not as a personal taste or an
expression of his uniqueness or special calling, which I would
understand as Fi, but as something impersonal.  His argument is that
The Prisoner merits this appreciation and dedication because of its
objectively high quality: its faithfulness to the timeless nature of
the things that it's about, its successful and extraordinarily full
realization of what it is.  Neil is supposed to respect The
Prisoner, not Larry Groznic; any respect for Larry Groznic would
derive from Larry's appreciation of The Prisoner and his endless
demonstrations of loyalty to it.

So, in Lenore terms, I understand this as an extreme dominant-Ti
perspective demanding that cultural Fe standards be redefined to fit
it, and announcing willingness to pay the price in lost relationship
if others don't play along.

As for N and S, I have a harder time explicitly pointing these out,
but the article also seems to well illustrate tertiary Si, at least
in my current vague understanding of it.
Obviously, there are the gobs of facts
memorized and loved, but what I am thinking of is better described
as foot-dragging: a perversely ISFJ-like sense that if we don't hold
fast to our Prisoner-inspired traditions, something truly precious
will be lost, undermining the basis of Larry's friendship with Neil
and the other Prisoner fans.
