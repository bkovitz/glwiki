= The [[Secondary Function]] for INFJs =

Hypothesis: INFJs typically use their [[Secondary Function]], [[Extraverted Feeling]], to criticize the ways in which people are benefiting each other as being one-sided or to deflate people's attempts to gain respect and admiration in their society by contributing to it.  "Snicker, snicker, this fellow's trying to look all altruistic, but notice how he makes sure that other people notice every time he does anything kind?  C'mon, this is so transparently self-interested."

Development of the [[Secondary Function]] to gain a genuinely [[Extraverted]] balance would come by finding ways to benefit ''from'' other people.  Fe as a channel for establishing and pursuing stakes in the [[Extraverted]] world consists of creating mutual loyalty between yourself and others, so that you benefit as well as them.  What do the people around you have to offer ''you?''  How can you show that you recognize that your fate is bound up with theirs--and collect your chips for making your contribution?
