On this page, we look at the conditions that different [[Semiotic Attitudes]] need to have met before a person can feel oriented.  This might explain why [[You Cant Make Me Look]].

----

Fi: Until I see how this relates to a need of a living being, I don't see how I can relate to it.

Fe: Until I can see where this fits into my network of tribal bonds and obligations, I don't see how I can relate to it.

Ti: Until I can see a causal principle at work, I don't see how I can relate to it.

Te: Until I can see how you would make an empirical test for what you're saying, I don't see how I can relate to it.

Si: Until I can find it on a map, I don't see how I can relate to it.

Se: Until I see how people are going to perceive this, I don't see how I can relate to it.

Ni: Until I can separate myself from its presumed interpretations, I refuse to relate to it.

Ne: If I can't broaden the context to make it mean something else, then I refuse to relate to it.
