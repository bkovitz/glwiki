'''A definition'''

[[Extraverted Sensation]] (Se) is the attitude that whatever is manifest (apparent, observable) calls forth an obvious and natural response, that has nothing to do with the way you need to respond in any other moment.  The meaning of everything is readily apparent--at the time that it appears.  Your instincts at each moment will tell you what to do; there is no point in anticipating.

'''[[Extraverted Sensation]] in the New Testament?'''

Matthew 6:28-34

And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the
field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I
say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
like one of these.  Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the
field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall
he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall
we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?  (For after all these
things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that
ye have need of all these things.  But seek ye first the kingdom of
God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto
you.

Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take
thought for the things of itself.

= Negotiation, Se-style =

When people negotiate, Se-style, they make it viscerally apparent that pleasure immediately follows doing as they want and pain immediately follows turning them down.

The sort of negotiation that Joe Pesci's characters engage in in movies would be a hyper-Se form of ESTP-style negotiation.  The person he is dealing with knows, at a physical, visceral, undebatable level, that he will be much happier if he plays along.  Joe Pesci's characters expand their power, influence, and sense of who they are by sensing what viscerally matters to the people around them and using it.
