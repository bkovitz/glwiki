'''What do ant pheromones mean?'''

The following might illustrate [[Introverted Intuition]] as a [[Semiotic Attitude]].

There are certain organisms that live as parasites on ant colonies.  They live nearly motionless most of their lives, inside an ant colony.  Ants bring them food.  Ants just keep on bringing them more and more food, which the parasites eat and eat and eat.

Why do the ants do that?  Because the parasite emits the same pheromones that ant larvae emit to signal that they need to be fed.  It doesn't matter that the parasite grows to 20 times the size of an ant larva and never seems to take a break from eating.  The ants receive the pheromone that means "I'm a larva and I'm hungry" and they obey.

What, then, do those pheromones really mean?  From the standpoint of [[Introverted Intuition]], the pheromones do not mean "I'm a larva and I'm hungry."  Clearly they don't mean that, because they can be sent by non-larvae.  What they mean is ''the way the ants respond.''

More generally, the meaning of a sign is whatever an interpreter of the sign does with it, not something external to the interpreter.

Heuristically, [[Introverted Intuition]] can lead you to use signals in ways that have nothing to do with or go directly against their built-in or "intended" interpretations.  Hence the common INJ fondness for irony.

[[Introverted Intuition]] (Ni) is the attitude that, whatever is manifest (apparent, observable, described) is only the tiniest fraction of the total reality and all of its potential, and it is manifest only because it serves one purpose and not one of an infinity of others.  Ni is the attunement to that "what else": what lurks in the shadow of that manifestation?  What does the observation or description leave out by by virtue of its being an observation or description?

As a [[Dominant Function]], Ni leads INJs to anchor themselves primarily in discovery of and attunement to that "what else"--to seek communion with it for its own sake.

As a [[Secondary Function]], Ni typically leads ENJs to be aware of alternative ways of negotiating the social world, that exploit the assumptions that people make in order for there to be a social world.  One might use this awareness to be on guard against cheaters, to prevail by setting knots and traps for others to fall into, to commit to a vision that might currently seem impossible, or a thousand other ways to serve or create an [[Extraverted]] goal.

As a [[Tertiary Function]], Ni typically leads ISPs to suspect others of hypocrisy and cheating and putting on appearances aimed at exploiting people's credulity--especially hypocrisy inherent in social institutions.  Sometimes ISPs draw upon Ni to find ways to throw a monkey wrench into social systems that call them into some kind of obligation: to respond in ways that don't make sense within the system's assumptions of cooperativeness.

As an [[Inferior Function]], Ni typically leads ESPs to either self-doubt or claim to a mystic vision--to see themselves as a sort of oracle of transcendent truth.
