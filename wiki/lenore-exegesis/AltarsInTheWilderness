p. 205: "Building a lifetime of temporary
altars in the wilderness can, of course, be an honorable choice." (Speaking of ENPs.)

What is an "altar in the wilderness"?

= Abraham in the desert =

It ''might'' be an allusion to Abraham wandering around the
desert staking out territory for his God.  Almost all religions in the
Middle East at the time assumed that their gods were confined to spacial
neighborhoods of influence, and erecting altars wherever you went was a way
to invite your God to follow you around.

But how would that be an analogy for Ne?

= Specified vs. Non-Specified Context =

Ne can be said to be contextual as all intuition is, but non-specified.  The altar to the Gods doesn't depend upon a pre-defined framework.  Ne takes things as they come.  Ne merges with implicit possibility.  Changing the terrain sprouts up new altars.

Ni can be said to be contextual as all intuition is, but specified.  A temple to the Gods depends upon a pre-defined framework.  Ni discriminates implicit possibility.  Changing the terrain changes the perspective on the temple.
