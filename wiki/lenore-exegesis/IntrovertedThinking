'''A definition'''

[[Introverted Thinking]] (Ti) is the attitude that beneath the complexity of what is manifest (apparent, observed, experienced) there is an underlying unity: a source or essence that emerges and takes form in different ways depending on circumstances.  What is manifest is seen as a manifestation ''of'' something.  From a Ti standpoint, the way to respond to things is in a way that is faithful to that underlying cause or source and helps it emerge fully and complete, without interference from any notion of self.  The way to understand that underlying essence is to learn to simultaneously see many relationships within what is manifest, to see every element in relation to every other element, the relationships being the "signature" of the underlying unity.  This can only be experienced directly, not second-hand.

p. 210: "Unlike [[Extraverted Thinking]], which is conceptual and generalized, [[Introverted Thinking]] motivates strategic action in a specific situation.  When ENTPs use it, they don't start with abstract rules and apply them, step by step, to bring about a goal.  They recognize themselves as part of an ongoing process, and they keep adjusting their behaviors in terms of the whole picture."

p. 210: "When combined with [[Extraverted Intuition]], [[Introverted Thinking]] can be highly cerebral, and it usually involves a complex imaginal pattern of relationships.  For example, an ENTP might enjoy playing chess, because such types can usually anticipate the results of many potential combinations of moves.  An ENTP salesperson might pull together a host of small details and recognize in one mental image how a customer is likely to respond to a product.  An ENTP cultural historian might see how a seemingly insignificant detail in a popular movie actually defines the underlying ethos of a culture."
