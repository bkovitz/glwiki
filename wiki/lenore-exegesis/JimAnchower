= Hypothesis: ISTP =

It seems so obvious that Jim Anchower is an ISTP.  He's like the Platonic archetype of [[ISTPs]].

He matches the [[David Keirsey]] profile perfectly, but does his behavior line up in any obvious way with [[Lenore]]-attitudes?

== Jim Anchower preaches [[Extraverted Sensation]] ==

From [[Jim Anchower's All About Living Life to the Fullest http://www.theonion.com/opinion/index.php?issue=4023&o=2]]:

"It just goes to show you that you never know when it'll be your time to go. One second you're on the phone trying to win $500, the next you have an axle through your lungs. Well, after hearing about Dan, I decided that Jim Anchower is gonna live every day like it's his last. No more wishing I'd drank that MGD, smoked that bowl, or punched that guy. It's all gonna be balls-out from now on.

"First thing I'm gonna do, if I can get the money together, is buy myself a bag of weed big enough to last me at least a month. Then I'm gonna get all my friends together at my place to smoke up and eat pizza. Then, when we're full, we'll smoke up again and play video games. I'm gonna win every game, because I'll have the thing that no one else has: a new lease on life. After everyone leaves, I'm gonna go to bed and sleep as late as I want. Then I'm gonna get up and start all over again.

"...From now on, it's my way or the highway. If people don't see eye-to-eye with me, fuck 'em. I'm not gonna waste my time trying to talk sense to people if they're just gonna be ballbags. Unless they're cashiers and I have to buy food or something from them, in which case, I suppose I'll feel sorry for them, since they don't have an enlightened point of view like me."

The vast majority of Jim Anchower's columns, though, well illustrate [[Introverted Thinking]].  To use the terminology above, he's "trying to talk sense to people".  He protests that people are doing things stupidly, without the proper respect for how they naturally work.
