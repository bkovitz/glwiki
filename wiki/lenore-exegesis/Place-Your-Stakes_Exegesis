= Where is your stake in things? =
Perhaps from an extraverted standpoint, your stake in things is in the world:

* In specific results that you want to achieve ([[Extraverted Thinking]])
* In your standing in the community and your relationships with specific people ([[Extraverted Feeling]])
* In unknown and unrealized potential that you hope to release([[Extraverted Intuition]])
* In action and enjoyment right now, doing what comes naturally ([[Extraverted Sensation]])

And perhaps from an introverted standpoint, your stake in things is not defined in terms of something in the world, but in the realization or existence, in any form, of a kind of pattern or way of being:

* In harmony of elements, rational order, emergent design revealing an underlying principle ([[Introverted Thinking]])
* In harmony between living needs and the environment ([[Introverted Feeling]])
* In communion with a transcendent reality ([[Introverted Intuition]])
* In faithfulness to the natural order of things ([[Introverted Sensation]])

Developing a function, then, would work like this:

* For extraverted functions, finding things in the world to have a stake in and learning how to achieve it.
* For introverted functions, becoming aware of something that matters to you, a calling, that could be realized in an infinity of possible ways.

The unpleasantness we experience when our [[Inferior Function]] leads us to do or feel things outside our normal sense of self, would be a symptom of neglecting either the extraverted or introverted side of life.  The part of the brain that looks out for our interests in the way that we have most neglected sends an alarm and demands action.
