This might be what [[Lenore Thomson]] means by ''introversion'' and ''extraversion'' (as attitudes that people can take, not as personality types).

----

From an extraverted perspective, the social arena you are in is a given; you try to figure out a way to fit into it.  From an extraverted perspective, you can't judge the rules of the social arena; you are ''in'' the social arena, and there are no thoughts to think except how to get around within the social arena, ways to do well in socially recognized ways, etc.

From an introverted perspective, you see things from a timeless perspective that enables you to criticize the social arena and its rules, and to willingly do good even when it comes with a steep social price.

The social arena is an ever-shifting flux of common understandings, changing always because people either negotiate changes to the social agreement or find ways to incorporate things from outside the current limits of the social agreement.  Different [[Extraverted]] [[Function Attitudes]] prevail at different times in history.  [[Introverted]] attitudes, however, are incapable of serving as a common framework for a society, because (by definition) they open up a person's talents without regard for social comprehensibility.

When [[Extraverted Judging]] attitudes bind the society, there is an understanding that the shared enterprise requires that people sacrifice some of their desires: that the rules that make up the negotiated social contract are there for everyone's benefit--that holding some of our impulses at bay is ultimately for everyone's benefit.  During a time when Je attitudes dominate, [[Introverted Perception]] is needed to soften the harshness and impersonality of the rules to take into account unique circumstances that the rules were not formed to address and that perhaps no rules can address.

When [[Extraverted Perceiving]] attitudes bind the society, there is an understanding that each individual should fully live out his own uniqueness, that the result is mostly synergy and fun for everyone.  Social rules are seen as ways in which the people who created those rules benefit at the expense of people who have less of a say in those rules.  During a time when Pe attitudes dominate, [[Introverted Judgement]] is needed to hold people back from exercising power simply because they can, and consider themselves answerable to a higher authority than "whatever plays to the crowd".

To put all this another way, extraversion makes you a politician while introversion makes you a saint.

== Developing a [[Secondary Function]] ==
Seen through this exegesis, [[Lenore]]'s basic proposition that when you're stuck in life, the answer is found via the [[Secondary Function]], this boils down to:

* When politicians are running out of options and don't know what to do, the answer is to become a little bit saintly: to do something for its own sake, without regard for political repercussions.  They may well find that the political repercussions of doing the right thing are actually quite good, in addition to reducing anxiety.  Saintliness actually enables you to connect with people on a deeper level.  There is just no way to understand that until you do it.

* When saints feel like the world is against them--that bad, powerful people seem to run everything and not give a damn about what's right--the answer is to become a bit of a politician: try doing something that people can perceive and understand and relate to--try bending with the social currents a bit.  This might seem like selling out, but it won't be.  It's entering an unknown world, where other people's interests and limitations have to be taken into account, and your own part in things is just a tiny part of the totality.

== The [[Function Attitudes]] seen through this exegesis ==
Se types make a place for themselves in the social arena by creating an attractive image--attractive according to current tastes.  Their main tool is ''impactfulness:'' sensing what will stand out and get people's attention.

Si types hold steady to things that they see as mattering regardless of change.

Ne types make a place for themselves in the social arena by sensing what is latent or unexpressed and presenting themselves as the people who bring it.  Their main tool is ''suggestiveness:'' sensing what their audience will perceive as suggesting something transformative and desirable.

Ni types are pioneers of new ways of perceiving.  They explore gaps and blind spots in society's ways of understanding and deciding.

Te types make a place for themselves in the social arena through the creation of contracts--they find ways to make promises that they can keep, and which are fair to all.  Their main tool is ''rules:'' rules created by agreement, which define a common vocabulary for people to negotiate, resolve disputes, and know where they stand with others.

Ti types attune themselves to a harmony of things that emerges from the things and not from social agreement.  They bring an understanding of ''natural law'', doing the right thing even when the man-made law forbids it.

Fe types make a place for themselves in the social arena through the creation of networks of mutual loyalty.  Fe types find ways to make themselves socially important, as measured by how many people depend on and value them.  Their main tool is: ''relationship:'' ways in which people understand their very selves as bound together in a common fate.

Fi types attune themselves to whatever is humane and decent, without regard for how important or attractive someone is socially.  They give aid to people who fall through the cracks of the social system, regardless of whether anyone rewards them for this.

Your particular [[Secondary Function]] provides a ''feasible'' way for you to enter the world of politics or the world of right-doing-for-its-own-sake.

For example, left-brain politicians (EJs) can tap into a kind of saintliness that is relevant and beneficial to their existing lives by pausing and allowing themselves to become aware of and appreciate the rich quirkiness and complexity of the world, the vastness that lies beyond the simple categories through which we judge what's better and worse for ourselves.  [[Introverted Perception]] is for them a way to stop making rulings on every new piece of information they hear and just listen without judgement for a while.  A great example of this is minister [[Jack Groverland http://www.jackgroverland.com]], presumably an ENTJ, whose main message is "Be still."

Left-brain saints (IJs) already have that appreciation of the uncategorizable and patternless.  Every day for them is already a sacrament to a world overwhelmingly rich in things to focus on that don't fit into any conceptual framework.  The problem for them is not to be still but to find an orderly enough way of existing to relate to other people, lest they fall into sheer schizophrenia.  Some achieve this by holding fast to a small part of the world where the social rules are especially well-defined and stable, such as deep inside a large corporation or academia.  [[Extraverted Judgement]], though, can provide more than form for otherwise amorphous experience: it also can provide a lens through which they can see themselves as active participants in the wider world of opportunities, risks, and negotiation of both common and conflicting interests.

But it actually leads them to an even greater communion with the world, in broader ways than they can imagine.

== The hemisphere that binds the society ==
The social arena is an ever-shifting flux of common understandings, changing always because people either negotiate changes to the social agreement or find ways to incorporate things from outside the current limits of the social agreement.  Different [[Extraverted]] [[Function Attitudes]] prevail at different times in history.  [[Introverted]] attitudes, however, are incapable of serving as a common framework for a society, because (by definition) they open up a person's talents without regard for social comprehensibility.

When [[Extraverted Judging]] attitudes bind the society, there is an understanding that the shared enterprise requires that people sacrifice some of their desires: that the rules that make up the negotiated social contract are there for everyone's benefit--that holding some of our impulses at bay is ultimately for everyone's benefit.  During a time when Je attitudes dominate, [[Introverted Perception]] is needed to soften the harshness and impersonality of the rules to take into account unique circumstances that the rules were not formed to address and that perhaps no rules can address.

When [[Extraverted Perceiving]] attitudes bind the society, there is an understanding that each individual should fully live out his own uniqueness, that the result is mostly synergy and fun for everyone.  Social rules are seen as ways in which the people who created those rules benefit at the expense of people who have less of a say in those rules.  During a time when Pe attitudes dominate, [[Introverted Judgement]] is needed to hold people back from exercising power simply because they can, and consider themselves answerable to a higher authority than "whatever plays to the crowd".

== Getting into trouble ==

Introverts get into extraverted trouble when they declare that there ''should not'' be a social price to pay for doing the right thing.  For example, declaring that the important things that most people don't respect, ''ought to'' be respected.  Introverts can come up with all sorts of reasons why people ought to respect the things that the introvert cares about, but if they don't play in the social arena, there ''is'' a cost to supporting them.  The truth is, the world is a bigger place than an introvert's mind, no matter how knowledgeable the introvert.

Declaring that people ought to attend to or value things differently than they do just puts you into a weak bargaining position.  You find yourself demanding that people behave differently than they do, finding them unmoved, demanding more forcefully, coming across ever more laughable and irrelevant.  You find yourself up against something way bigger than you are: the world beyond yourself, the place where extraverts are most comfortable.

Extraverts get into introverted trouble when they overextend themselves.  ''More detail, anyone?''

At this point, it looks like your only choices are to become a hopelessly ineffectual saint, going down with your ship as a point of honor, or a soulless sell-out, grasping all the power you can and abusing it all you can, purely as a matter of survival.  This dilemma is the result of the [[inferior function]] trying to assert itself--trying to compensate directly for the weaknesses of a purely political or purely saintly approach.

Here's one possible way it might work with some ENTJs.  Playing a very hard game of taking responsibility, making promises and consistently delivering on them, you find yourself in some strange way muffled by other people's petty concerns and narrow minds.  You start seeing yourself as the saint: ''you've'' always done the honorable thing, keeping your agreements, making no claims beyond what you can prove, a paragon of fairness and objectivity.  Why, oh why, is this world covered in soft-headed troglodytes who couldn't change their own diapers without someone to tell them what to do?  Isn't a saint entitled to some wiggle room?  Don't my much higher concerns justify bypassing the law and trampling over some of these morons?  Don't I have the right to be fully myself?  Don't I have that right ''unconditionally,'' simply because of what I am?

That's a direct clash between Te and Fi ways of understanding your situation.  One's faithfulness to law--justifying self-indulgence and breaking of the law.  Some creepily ENTJ "personal transformation" seminars turn this into something bordering on Se/Fi criminality, in the name of "honesty".  If you "honestly" feel like punching someone in the face, then it would be "dishonest" not to...

Or...you can find another way.  What if you looked at things not in terms of the law or agreements or who is right and who is wrong, but just looked at things as they are, independent of any purpose or criteria or interpretation?  There's no telling what you might see.  That's why it's a fruitful place to look.  You won't find more ways to expand and dominate, you'll find ways to see outside the limits of your own categories and criteria.  You'll find things of value that are not definable in terms of getting your way vs. someone else getting their way.  You'll find things that you can't define at all and that can't be proven by empirical test, but are nevertheless real.  And you'll see how "winning" often comes with a cost.  You'll even be able to see the elements of truth in the ideas of those soft-headed troglodytes.  ''Everything'' will become useful to you, with your expanded understanding of what is useful.  You'll become intelligently patient, because you'll know what's feasible now and what isn't.

That would be an example of [[developing the secondary]] with Ni as the [[secondary function]].  The secondary opens your eyes to what was already plainly visible but that you weren't looking at because in some way you thought it unworthy of your attention.  For politicians, the secondary provides an avenue to saintliness by becoming more of a person--becoming more worthy of political success.  For saints, the secondary provides an avenue into political success by learning to deal with things greater than yourself, beyond your total control or understanding.
