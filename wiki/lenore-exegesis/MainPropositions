Here are the main propositions from [[Personality Type: An Owner's Manual http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0877739870/ref=greenlightwik-20]]:

# Within each person, there is an inherently unresolvable tug-of-war between [[Extraverted]] and [[Introverted]] attitudes: the clash between them creates a healthy ability to adapt and live, bringing out more and more of a person's potential.
# People tend to take primarily an [[Extraverted]] or [[Introverted]] attitude toward life, which they further specialize via a [[Dominant Function]].
# When the life they have created by making sense of things via their [[Dominant Function]] has pushed them too far out of balance in an [[Extraverted]] or [[Introverted]] way, the opposite or [[Inferior Function]] floods them with motives and dissatisfactions that have no place in their accustomed sense of self. Nor can the callings of the [[Inferior Function]] be satisfied directly; they're too far opposed to a person's current investments, and virtually unknowable from the person's present perspective.
# When you get stuck in life that way, usually solutions come very quickly if you develop your [[Secondary Function]].  However, your [[Secondary Function]] calls upon you to broaden and extend your very sense of who you are and what is important.  It leads you into genuinely unknown regions of your potential as a human being.
# When those times come, we experience a [[Tertiary Temptation]]: to understand our situation in terms of our [[Tertiary Function]], supporting our present sense of self and explaining our problems in our customarily [[Extraverted]] or [[Introverted]] terms.

You might find these propositions difficult to understand because the terms are unfamiliar and their meanings are unclear.  You are not alone!  Those are [[Our Difficulties]], the ones that [[this wiki http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis]] exists to address.
