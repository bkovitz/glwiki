= Developing [[Extraverted Thinking]] =

How do INTJs develop Te?

Hypothesis: By developing a bargaining position consisting of the ability to promise and deliver useful results that other people understand and value.

(This is essentially an elaboration of the [[Saints-and-Politicians Exegesis]].)

Acquiring capabilities that other people can understand and value moves you into a position where you can see more to do in the world than declaring it unworthy of superior beings like yourself.  It radically transforms your whole perspective on life.  You might still retain and enjoy the "commentator" pose, but your observations will be greatly enriched by real experience as a participant.

Having a bargaining position stronger than "I can point out that you're not omniscient" or "I can draw a bar higher than you can reach" will satisfy that need for power.  You won't need to come up with rationalizations for why you're powerless or why people ignore you, nor will you be tempted by dreams of impossibly grandiose sorts of power.  You'll have a small amount of real power and influence in the world, and people will have good reason to listen to you.  You may even find something beneficial to do with that power.

Where ''will'' negotiation lead you?  You have no idea until you get there.  There are some things that cannot be known by foresight.  All you can do is pick some small, feasible goal, bring everything you've got, and achieve it.  And then you'll be in a new position, able to see new options--options that were invisible from the position of total forethought.

''A possible problem with this hypothesis''

Doesn't this amount to selling out?  If you've got some ineffable vision, how is learning some pedestrian trade going to help you bring that to life?

Perhaps the answer is unknowable before you engage.  The answer may be that that ineffable vision is mostly bullshit, and only worldly experience will give you the perspective to see that for yourself.  The answer may also be that even a pedestrian trade is miraculous once you experience it.

== A trap ==

A peculiar way that some INTJs develop a bargaining position is by finding a niche deep within a world where no negotiation is necessary, like academia.  There, one is given some very low expectations to meet, and then one can "play Te", endlessly judging things by holding them up to standards that real things can't possibly meet.  Postmodernism and analytic philosophy might be prime examples of these INTJ-traps.

If you're happy there, maybe there's no need to escape the trap.  But if you sense some calling within yourself to make a contribution, or just to ''exist'' more fully, you need to bring Te into the game in a more genuinely [[extraverted]] way: by accomplishing ''tangible'' goals.

== Another trap ==

Another way that secondary Te can become an [[introverted]] trap is when you manage your affairs so that nothing unexpected can happen, and you can live life by "phoning it in".  For example, INTJs in managerial jobs who keep everything in both work and family life completely predictable.  Family and co-workers feel "straitjacketed" around you: they know that everything they say will be re-interpreted in terms of some hard-set criteria.  You find yourself viewing every new thing through a very narrow lens.  Through that lens, everyone looks appallingly stupid.  You've become oblivious to the fact that they're interested in things that have nothing to do with the game you're so skilled at managing.  Here, a small dose of worldly power has become a tool to avoid living.

Perhaps the only way out of this sort of trap is to quit and do radically different--something that will call upon you to engage more of yourself, learn new concepts, and deal with things that are not so easily controllable.
