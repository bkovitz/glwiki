A ''function-attitude'' is a Jungian function used in an [[Extraverted]] or [[Introverted]] attitude.

There are four functions:

 [[Sensation]]
 [[Intuition]]
 [[Thinking]]
 [[Feeling]]

That makes eight function-attitudes:

 [[Extraverted Sensation]]
 [[Extraverted Intuition]]
 [[Extraverted Thinking]]
 [[Extraverted Feeling]]
 [[Introverted Sensation]]
 [[Introverted Intuition]]
 [[Introverted Thinking]]
 [[Introverted Feeling]]

[[Lenore]] often refers to function-attitudes just as "functions".

[[Lenore]] often refers to function-attitudes just as "functions", which goes back to Jung. Why did Jung choose the term "function"? Presumably to get psychology to sound like physics or mathematics.

"A." Random House definition of function: #1 the kind of action or activity proper to any person or thing #2 the purpose for which something is designed or exists.
As an INFJ, it makes perfect sense to me. Your function is what serves your purpose, it is what's proper to yourself.

A. Because each function has a different purpose for being there, and possibly because it sounded right to Jung's Ti. It could also be said as: "Each function has a different function," but that would be repetitive and impossible to understand. Do you use Si for the same thing for which you use Fe? No. They're far from the same. See [Tertiary Temptation]. (--[Rebekah])
