''Te:'' Judging vs. Navigating

''Ti:'' Spinning the truth vs. Seeing the whole truth

''Ne:'' Idle curiosity vs. Opportunism

''Ni:'' Exploiting blind spots vs. Seeing the validity of other perspectives

''Fe:'' Serving vs. Negotiating

''Fi:'' Pleasure-seeking vs. Seeing what is truly good

''Se:'' Idle amusement vs. Being present

''Si:'' Seeking facts to support a purpose vs. Allowing yourself to see whatever facts are there
