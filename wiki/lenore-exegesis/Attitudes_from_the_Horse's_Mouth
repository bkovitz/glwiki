Relating to [[Type from Scratch]], here are some observations about finding descriptions of [[function attitude]]s by the people whose sense of self takes shape through them.  This might be among the most direct evidence for the existence of [[function attitude]]s.

= First, a difficulty: the invisible dominant =

When people read [[Lenore]]'s descriptions of types and attitudes, even the attempts at [[exegesis]] posted on this site, they seldom recognize themselves in their [[dominant function]].  The reaction is usually something like, "Whah?  Maybe sorta kinda, but this hardly seems like."

When people read [[Lenore]]'s descriptions of types and attitudes, or even the attempts at [[exegesis]] posted on this site, they seldom recognize themselves in their [[dominant function]].  The reaction is usually something like, "Whah?  Maybe sorta kinda, but this hardly seems like me."

A [[dominant function]], after all, is your main universe of description, and a universe of description does not include itself.  It's the lens, not what you see.

So is it possible to get descriptions of [[function attitude]]s by the very people who use them for [[ego orientation]]?  Or is the only way to discover [[function attitude]]s painstaking observation of people's behavior and spoken self-understanding for years to find implicit rules?

The hypothesis of this page is that people do often describe their own preferred [[function attitude]]s.  But it's under slightly unusual circumstances.

== Identifying with the secondary ==

First, people ''do'' usually identify with descriptions of their [[secondary function]].  Watching the INTJ and INTP discussion lists, people who are new to the theory often mistake their [[secondary function]] for their [[dominant function]].  [[INTJs]], for example, often think of themselves as primarily rational in the sense of being "systematic", and reasonably infer that "[[thinking]]", perhaps "[[introverted thinking]]'', would be their [[dominant function]].  [[INTPs]] often think of themselves as primarily imaginative, outside-the-box thinkers, and reasonably infer that "[[intuition]]", perhaps "[[introverted intuition]]", would be their [[dominant function]].

Could it be that they're describing their favored [[extraverted]] attitude?  Casual, anecdotal evidence suggests that extraverts also typically identify with their [[secondary function]], though.  For example, [[ENTPs]] and [[ESTPs]] think of themselves as analytical and having a good "hands-on" understanding of things.  "Let me get my hands on it and I can figure it out.  It's just a magical talent of mine."

''More examples:'' [[ISTPs]] and [[ISFPs]] often think of themselves as primarily "cool" or "hip". [[ISFJs]] and [[INFJs]] tend to understand themselves mainly in terms of their personal loyalties to others.

== Preaching the secondary ==

If you really want to hear a [[function attitude]] described, though, just listen to what they preach as the very most important insight about life--the thing that everyone needs to learn to do .

For example, [[Jack Groverland http://www.jackgroverland.com]], presumably ENTJ, preaches to "be still" and "tune in to what the greater intelligence of the universe wants you to do."  A great many [[ENTJs]] seem to preach primarily that reasoning and intellect have limits, and it's critical to learn to perceive in a direct way, not limiting yourself to what you can prove "logically", but tuning in to the totality of everything through a sort of direct perception.  A favorite preaching of [[ENFJs]] and [[ENTJs]] is that you are "responsible" for creating your reality by the kind of attitude that you choose: the world isn't doing things to you, you are self-selecting for certain kinds of things to happen to you by the way that you assign meaning to things and lead yourself to perceive one way and not another.  This all sounds very much like articulate descriptions of [[introverted intuition]]--straight from the horse's mouth, just it's these horses' [[secondary function]].  (See [[Eric Berne]] for a possibly ENFJ take on this.)

(A lot of the attempts at describing [[function attitude]]s that I've written on this site have been inspired as much by people's preaching of this sort, on the assumption that they're describing their [[secondary function]], as [[Lenore]]'s own descriptions.  --[[Ben Kovitz]])

So this might be one of the main pieces of evidence that [[function attitude]]s exist: the correlation between people's types on four-letter-code personality tests, and what they preach when they preach an attitude.

''More examples:''

[[ISFJs]] and [[INFJs]] often preach a strong case that obligation is created not merely by voluntary agreement, but by being born into and participating in life as a human being.  "Life is with people."  See [[Extraverted Feeling]].

[[ESFPs]] and [[ENFPs]] often preach that success in life comes mainly from some form of "getting right with God": clarifying or understanding your values and accepting them unconditionally, or tuning into what is [[living]] in every form that it takes.  See [[Introverted Feeling]].

[[INTPs]] and [[INFPs]] often preach "thinking outside the box" and the importance of adjusting and adapting creatively and spontaneously to whatever happens, not imposing ''a priori'' criteria on things.  The phrase "[[outside the box http://greenlightwiki.com/improv/Outside_the_Box]]" is usually a tip-off that someone is talking about taking the attitude of [[Extraverted Intuition]].

[[ISTJs]] and [[INTJs]] often preach "meeting expectations": doing your defined part in the overall social structure by doing your own job, rather than insisting on going your own way and thus getting out of sync with the community.  Going your own way comes with a social cost, they like to say, because since it can't be defined and isn't predictable, it can't serve as a basis for social organization.  They also tend to preach doing things systematically and "rationally", always making sure that each new step is built on a secure foundation rather than "taking shots in the dark".  See [[Extraverted Thinking]].

[[ESTPs]] and [[ENTPs]] often preach the importance of ''understanding'' what you're doing, and that this has got to come from hands-on experience, not lectures and taking notes and junk like that.  You have to experiment, get your hands dirty, push things until they break, and then you really know ''for yourself'' how they work.  See [[Introverted Thinking]].

[[ESTJs]] and [[ESFJs]] often preach "knowing what is important to you and taking responsibility for it."  If everyone just took care of and protected what mattered to them, we'd all be in fine shape.  For example, if everyone locked up their valuables, then there wouldn't be any thieves in this world.  See [[Introverted Sensation]].

[[ISTPs]] and [[ISFPs]] often preach "go with the flow, man."  They like to preach that since you can't control the world, you've got to just go with what you feel like doing at each moment, without anticipating the future and without being connected to the past.  Have fun ''now,'' man, tomorrow you could be hit by a bus.  Just "be."  See [[Extraverted Sensation]].

= Preaching the dominant in indignation =

People also preach their [[dominant function]], but here's a hypothesis; they preach the dominant mainly out of indignation when someone pushes them toward their [[inferior function]]; they preach the dominant calmly mainly when they've come to also see themselves through their [[secondary function]].

For example, it's when you insist to an ISTP or INTP that he must say the politically correct thing in order to nurture his social loyalties, that typically triggers indignation.  That's when you see overtly antisocial behavior from [[ISTPs]] or get a lecture about how he needs a ''reason'' that he can understand for himself, and loyalties are fairly meaningless if we're just saying comforting things without regard for truth.  (See [[Larry Groznic]].)

== Preaching the tertiary and inferior ==

People even preach their tertiary and inferior attitudes.

''Hypothesis:'' People preach the inferior mostly as something that everyone else ought to do, and it's their failure to heed this fundamental moral principle that is the reason things are messed up.

''Hypothesis:'' People preach the tertiary mostly as a reason why they are helpless to do other than what they're doing.

A [[dominant function]], after all, is your main universe of description, and a universe of description does not include itself.  It's the lens, not what you see. Thus, the [[dominant function]] is so ingrained in their personality that you might think that everyone has it also. I remember reading a quote from Jung that supposedly he took a while to figure out that everyone else was not an Introverted Thinker (''has anyone else seen this quote or know where it is?''). Since everyone has arms, you wouldn't say "I'm a person with arms" when you describe yourself. Same with the [[dominant function]].
