Heck, I'm not even sure I know.

But I'll try to sum this up here anyway.

''Giving me Ti/Ne is like giving the average eight-year-old a flamethrower.''

Yeah, that pretty well sums it up. Except it's missing the research obsession, the annoying habit of correcting teachers, and the really odd sense of humor. Well, maybe that last one was captured there.

Name: Rebekah Yoder
Age: 13, at the moment.
Occupation: Seriously? You expect me to have one? Well, okay, student, writer, geek, and I definitely teach a lot.
Hobbies: Writing, reading, devising plots to get as many languages as possible into a high school schedule, karate, making fun of the news people, solving problems, spending time in a parallel dimension of my own creation... it's all good.
Type: INTP.
Other types I could possibly be: Maybe ENTP on a really weird day, but I'd be totally exhausted by the end of it.
Socionics: I have no clue. I haven't figured out socionics yet.

'''Weird Quirks: This could take all day.'''
*Skipped eighth grade.
*Wrote three novels and am working on a fourth... but that's not to say I'm satisfied with the 3 I wrote.
*Love cats.
*Um, female INTP?
*Spent most of my time as a 5-year-old launching carefully-thought-out crusades against Cruella DeVille.
*Almost ENTP-like knack for sarcasm.
*Huge MBTI/Jung/Lenore/Berens fan. This theory is awesome.
*I hate the enneagram theory. It doesn't make sense, and it doesn't stand up to actual practice. Scientific theories need to be tested before they're taken for truth, and this doesn't stand up under testing. Back to the drawing board for you!
*Actually, for all my skepticism with anything presented for the Truth Check, I'm a firm Christian. I see no scientific evidence against it, and quite a bit for it. Anyway, I've found way too many holes in evolution to buy into that junk. That's a rant that could also take all day.
*My web site is http://myexplodingcat.com. Don't ask me how I made it, because my brother did it. (He did an awesome job with it, too.)
*For an INTP, I'm actually not that social-avoid-ey. (I'm not going to say antisocial, because being introverted doesn't imply being antisocial--just states a different source of energy.) I'm guessing that it's because after being homeschooled for elementary and jumping into public sixth grade cold--OUCH, culture shock--and spending all of sixth grade running off of Ti, I learned to let Ne manage the social stuff pretty fast. Since then, I've probably become one of the most defiant and sarcastic INTPs you'll find, but still really easy-going. 
*I've been told I think too much. And that I'm a walking dictionary. And encyclopedia. But hey, I'm sure the teacher didn't mind when I stopped her WWI talk to inject the fact that the first bomb the Allies dropped on Berlin ended up in the zoo and killed the Nazi's only elephant. Or the time that one kid asked if Asperger's syndrome was real (he'd only seen it on YouTube, and it was being made fun of through the use of a cuss word and a beef product) and I gae a detailed explanation of Asperger's, and then launched into a discussion of how certain personality types (INTs in general, for example) can be misdiagnosed with Asperger's if they haven't developed their secondary function.
*You don't want to play me in chess. Trust me.
*I have this odd habit of explaining subjects to students more understandably than the teacher did, even if the teacher's really good. I guess it's an age/communication thing. I don't know.
*Even if someone typically annoys me, if they approach me with an academic question, I'll put anything aside to explain it for them, no matter if they're a good friend or an archenemy.
*I could probably count my true friends on one hand, unless my teachers count.
*Oh, yeah. I inevitably befriend my teachers faster and more easily than I befriend my peers. Usually after the first day, I have something to say similar to the Nazi thing, and will point it out after class. They tend to appreciate that where most people look at me and go, "...oh." and step slightly away.
*I told you this list would get long.

'''Novels'''

'''1.'''

Name: Tricks of the Light (TOTAL for short, and yes, I know there's no A)

Age I was when I wrote it: 10-11

How long it took: A year and a half

About: Oh, please. To sum it up... cliche chosen one thing, plot went nowhere, weird humor no one gets. Though one college-level English teacher who read it had to look up three words in a dictionary.

Am I satisfied with it?: Heck no.

Comments: Never doing that again.

'''2.'''

Name: Mirrorworld

Age I was when I wrote it: 11-12

How long it took: A year? I don't know.

About: Daniel and Sophie, two sixth-graders, are well-known to the school librarian (but not to each other). When they finally run out of books to read, the librarian ends up giving them each a book that isn't available to the other students. Those books end up being able to talk, and teach Daniel and Sophie magic... but they all end up going on a crazy quest to save the balance of magic through the parallel dimensions. It gets really complicated and random.

Am I satisfied with it: No, but it's better than TOTAL.

Comments: This thing has more characters than a Russian play. Also, I need to figure out an ending BEFORE I write the middle. There are a whole truckload of other problems here as well, especially regarding the villain. The bad part is that I always outsmart the villain and they lose major street cred with me.

'''3.'''

Name: Star

Age I was when I wrote it: 12-13

How long it took: Roughly a year, but the editing is still going on.

About: Ah, here we go. Amanda, an Earth Anoki (Anoki are basically elemental mages with wings, but they're extremely different from my fairies, who are eight inches tall and trigger-happy), is running away from her village in protest of a law enforced by the village's government, which is a sort of group dictatorship. Most Anoki pretty much pay their taxes and ignore the dictators, who don't give a rip as long as they're rich and well-fed. Amanda doesn't. Amanda's tribe/village, the Zepha tribe, is engaged in an ongoing war with the Kliid. Nobody knows exactly why the war started, but they're caught up in fighting and basically know that they should be holding a grudge against the other side. The Zepha tribe would lose, since the Kliid has extremely strong magicians and lots of people, but they don't have an Earth Anoki. With Amanda's healing magic, the Zepha tribe has managed to stay alive.


But there's a law, as mentioned before, that Amanda seriously disagrees with. The dictators require a spell to be cast on all child Anoki that "commits" them to their element. This spell has... some heavy side effects. You couldn't say it takes away their humanity, because they aren't human in the first place... but it takes away their Anoki-ity, and limits them to their current element, while supposedly allowing them to do better magic within that element. Amanda managed to learn about this, and totally flipped out. Since then, she's been dodging any attempt to Commit her. Not only is she concerned about the side effects, but she wants to learn Air magic, as the Air magicians are the only ones who can fly. So she runs away to try and learn Air magic from another village, reasoning that when she comes back, nobody will try to Commit her--after all, why get rid of a ''flying'' healer?.

However, the dictators are obviously not thrilled about this arrangement. Amanda's unofficial employment healing wounded soldiers was relied upon much too heavily to let the girl slip by for any reason, and especially not one that undermines the government's authority. So they're out to either persuade her to come back or kill her before she can join their enemies. The story unravels in a series of complex and immensely sarcastic scenes, narrated by Amanda, which can go from freaky to funny in .4 seconds.

Am I satisfied with it: ..... Under question. My Ne loves it, but my Ti editor is screaming that parts of it Don't Make Sense.

Comments: Oh... my... gawrsh.

'''4.'''

Name: Haven't come up with one yet, but I've nicknamed it Zoe so far.

Age I was when I wrote it: 13-still writing

How long it took: Don't know, still writing.

About: Zoe, a nine-year-old INTJ (ha ha ha ha ha) can do magic. How her magic works, however, is something nobody can figure out--including Zoe herself. It turns out that Zoe has a completely new type of magic that nobody has ever seen before, which is done through music (something Zoe isn't too thrilled about--she can be out of tune given a kazoo and Morse code). Once this is discovered, Zoe becomes determined to redeem herself in the eyes of the people who were trying to help her work her magic, who wasted their time for Zoe. She plans to do this by solving the local problem: a monster that kills magicians and takes their magic. However, if it manages to take Zoe's... it'll be unbeatable, because without the knowledge of the inner workings of Zoe's magic, none of even the most skilled magicians can stop the monster from using it. But the catch: the monster can't block Zoe's magic while she still has it, either! Is young Zoe strong enough to fend off a monster that's killed dozens of other magicians? Ah, well, only one way to find out.
