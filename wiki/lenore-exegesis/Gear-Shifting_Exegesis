Taking the attitude that "I will only understand this thing when I've learned to see it in terms of a zillion different representations, since nothing that you learn from any one of them implies anything about the rest."

The "representations" described above are things like words, numbers, and diagrams: artificial ways of describing things.

* Fi: Viewing things solely in terms of how you like them.  Taking the attitude that, "If I don't like it, what's the point?"

* Ne: Viewing things as parts of greater wholes.  Taking the attitude that, "until I've found a way to bring in elements from outside the game, why play?"

* Se: Viewing things solely in terms of their ability to play to a crowd and make an impression.  Taking the attitude that, "If no one sees it, why do it?"

* Te: Submitting things to well-articulated evaluation criteria, such as requirements, numerical measurements, and fitness for a predefined purpose.  Taking the attitude that, "until I know what criteria count as successful, I declare the entire activity irrational and pointless."

* Fe: Viewing things in terms of moves aimed at establishing oneself in a certain social position.  Taking the attitude that, "It's not what you know, it's who you know."

* It's a pure gear-shifting theory: just a collection of heuristics, suggesting nothing about internal conflicts, self-identity, why people would cling to one of these, or why a [[Secondary Function]] would be so helpful.

* It offers no answer to the question of why the same words are used to describe different [[Function Attitudes]]: for example, what the different [[Introverted]] attitudes have in common, or what the different [[Sensation]] attitudes have in common.
