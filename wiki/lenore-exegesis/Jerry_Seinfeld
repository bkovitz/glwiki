How about Jerry ENTP, George INTP, Kramer ESFP, Elaine ESFJ/ESTJ?
Jerry seems too comfortable in too many ways to be INTJ, and too interactive and contemplative and observant to be ISTP, but that's just my observation, I'm no expert. Plus ENTPs are the only NT function combination to use Extraverted Feeling in any tangible way, which it seems to me that Jerry does to get out of his messes. He's a charmer. I've yet to meet an INTJ or ISTP who "charms" much, or at least not very well.

And not all INTPs are smart per se, but one thing George does seem to be is excessively lacking in Extraverted Feeling, while meeting his immediate needs in an inventive kind of way. Sometimes I think if you do a Sherlockian method, and eliminate the impossible, whatever is left, however improbable, must be the truth. I mean, he lives with his parents, his fake career is in architecture, when he broke out of his tertiary-controlled patterns he got everything he wanted (for one episode), and he justifies eating garbage out of the trash - what else is there?

I think Kramer and Elaine are self-explanatory, although I think they mildly morphed Elaine from an ESFJ into an ESTJ over time. 

Kinda like the Beatles, I think they were great because they covered all of the function bases, until the last couple seasons when Elaine got really harsh.
