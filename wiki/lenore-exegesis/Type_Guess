A difference between the [[Lenore Thomson]] and [[David Keirsey]] or [[Myers-Briggs]] approaches to "typing" someone is that in the latter, you match people against profiles, but in the former, you understand their behavior and life situation as the result of an interplay of opposing [[function attitude]]s.

= Making a type guess =

When you make a type guess, please do two things in addition to stating a four-letter code:

* Point out some interesting concrete detail about the person that's relevant to your guess.  Better yet, point out lots of interesting concrete details.

* If it's not obvious, give some explanation, brief or long, of why those details relate to [[Lenore]]'s concepts, or at to least some particular interpretation of them.

This will give a reader (and yourself) much more food for thought than just an unexplained four-letter code.
