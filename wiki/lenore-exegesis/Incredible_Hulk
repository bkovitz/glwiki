As an experienced priramy school teacher, I know that kids can deal with playing in a park without parents. Not only can they deal with it, they NEED it! Let your kids be kids! Teach them the skills they need to function in the world without you. Kids are resilient, smart and capable of making difficult choices.  Leaving' your child does not have to mean abandoning them, it could mean taking a short walk around the park or reading a book a little way away. It means giving your children space to make choices and to fix mistakes. Children who are not given these opportunities turn into adults who cannot function in the real world.
