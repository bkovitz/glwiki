In [[Lenore's http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/LenoreThomson]] theory, the inferior function is an attitude that is pushed out of consciousness as a person develops a dominant attitude.  The attitude still exerts an influence on the person, but in a childish way.  The attitude leads the person to try to fulfill neglected needs, but in ways that clash with the rest of the person's life and self-understanding.  When you get way out of balance, the inferior attitude "floods" you with motives and emotions you don't understand.  You fall into a sort of ego-vertigo.

One of [[Lenore's http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/LenoreThomson]] main ideas is that you can't solve those sorts of problems by developing your inferior function directly.  She says that the path to consciously incorporating these neglected elements of yourself is through your secondary attitude.

'''The inferior function as your "alien hand"'''

p. 76 (Describing split-brain patients):

"When the left and right brains are no longer cooperating, it becomes clear that each hemisphere has a distinct personality of its own--memories, experiences, self-awareness, and goals that conflict with those of the other hemisphere.  Neurologists recognized the latter phenomenon when some split-brain patients developed a condition known as 'alien hand' syndrome.  Their left hand literally interfered with things the right hand was attempting to do.

"...Most of us favor functions governed by one side of the brain or another, which ensures that the 'alien side' of our personality receives little attention.  Eventually, we reach a state of typological imbalance.  Much as the 'alien hand' of a split-brain patient stops the other hand frem opening a door or putting on a sock, our least-developed function asserts its own priorities, flooding us with impulses that interfere with our usual goals."

In other words, by using your [[Inferior Function]], you are stepping outside of the criteria you have previously defined for yourself (Te).

If you try to use your [[Inferior Function]] when your [[Dominant Function]] is running full blast, your [[Dominant Function]] will usually take control through the [[Tertiary Temptation]], unless your [[Secondary Function]] intercedes with a new perspective. 

Of course, there are other explanations of why the [[Dominant Function]] and the [[Inferior Function]] clash besides Te and Ti:

''Se explanation'': People don't use their [[Inferior Function]] directly because they know that they know it is too weak to have any kind of impact.
''Fi explanation'': People don't use their [[Inferior Function]] directly because they don't want to compromise how they feel about themselves.
''Si explanation'': People don't use their [[Inferior Function]] directly because they know better than to carelessly dash off into uncharted territory.

'''The Semiotic Standpoint:''' The [[Inferior Function]] pressures you to take a different interpretation of certain signs than you are used to. However, this can lead you to become [[Semiotically Disoriented]]. Suddenly your [[inferior function]] confronts you with strange goals (due to different interpretations of signs), but your [[dominant function]] offers you no way to relate to them, let alone meet them. In fact, your [[dominant function]] will deny that these goals are even valid in the first place. It would love to sweep them under the carpet, and the [[Tertiary Temptation]] offers an excuse to do so. However, the [[secondary function]] may offer a way of interpreting signs that allows the [[dominant function]] to properly orient itself in relation to the goals of the [[inferior function]].

This makes sense both from the standpoint of the gear-shifting theory, and [[Lenore]]'s meaning filter theory mentioned in the [[Genus Problem]]. You cannot be in forward and reverse gear at the same time; neither can you can you assign meaning to a sign with two mutually exclusive attitudes.
