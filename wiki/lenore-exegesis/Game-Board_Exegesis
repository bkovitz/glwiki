This might be what [[Lenore Thomson]] means by ''extraversion'' and ''introversion'' (as attitudes that people can take, not as personality types).

----

Imagine that you and some friends are playing a board game together, like Monopoly.

Taking an extraverted attitude, what matters to you--what you define as being of interest to you and meriting your attention--is the game.  Every thought you think is about making a move in the game.  Everything you do is a move in the game.  The game offers things to gain, and you attempt to gain them.  If something doesn't register on the game board, where everyone can see it, it doesn't seem relevant.

Taking an introverted attitude, you explore ideas and pursue goals without necessarily relating them to the game board.  The game board stimulates you to explore or experience the world of what can be potentially explored or experienced.  This is the world of archetypes.  You might find the shapes of the pieces beautiful and focus on that, or you might find pleasure in engaging in moving the pieces around or rolling the dice, without regard for how these relate to success in the game.

A saint might intentionally lose at the game in order to get right with God or atone for a past sin.  From an extraverted attitude, saintliness is completely idiotic.  Monopoly doesn't give you any points for atoning for past sins!

'''Looking at the [[Function Attitudes]] this way'''

Here's how people might do [[Ego Orientation]] via their [[Dominant Function]] in this analogy:

Te: Apply strategies whose validity can be traced deductively back to the rules of the game.  Exploit the connectedness of the different elements of the game, as you can apply that knowledge to the present board situation.  You might not be able to see right nowhow your move will lead to victory, but you can always distinguish between a step toward it and a step away from it.

Ti: Explore and experience the structure of the game, the way its many elements relate, regardless of whether anyone else understands that or you see a payoff.

Se: Make moves that make a big impact, that surprise, can be seen, are dramatic, stand out from the rest of the action.  Action now!  You might not see how that leads to victory, but the whole path cannot be seen right now.  Surely action is the only way, though!

Si: Focus on aspects of the game that you can mentally represent and hold stable.

Fe: Find common cause with other players.  Cast your lot with some but not all.  You might not see how that leads all the way to victory, but surely loyalty will pay off--not just expedient loyalty, to gain some immediately visible purpose, but truly committed loyalty, demonstrated by things like sacrifice.

Fi: Work for the greater good: the players themselves, regardless of their scores in the game or how they can help your score.

Ne: Play by incorporating elements of the game that are not taken account of by the other players' strategies.  Mutate, morph, undermine assumptions, surprise people with how much more there is to the game than they're aware of.  You might not be able to see all the way to victory, but surely the best way to win is to exploit what the other players currently don't know--even if you yourself don't know much about it, either.  You get this advantage by releasing potential that no one has seen yet.

Ni: Mentally separate elements of the game: see ways in which what seems to be a connection between elements of the game actually depends on something that could be changed.

Of course the board-game analogy goes only so far, since board games end within an evening while life goes on for a long time.  Hopefully translating the board-game descriptions back to life overall is fairly obvious, though.

'''Extraverts and introverts'''

In this analogy, the difference between extraverts and introverts is not whether one takes an exclusively extraverted or introverted attitude: everyone uses both forms of awareness.  The difference is which is primary and which is made to serve the other.

Extraverts typically take an introverted attitude in order to think of better moves on the game board.

Introverts typically take an extraverted attitude in order to fuel their introverted quest or concerns.

For example, an extravert whose cognitive style leans toward Se might take an Fi attitude in order to tap into what will really please and attract people, in order to better understand what kind of action will get the most and best attention.  Empathy as part of getting attention.

An introvert who tends toward an Fi style might draw upon Se in order to find ways to make the greater good noticeable and understandable to people.  Hipness as market research.

Developing a [[Secondary Function]], then, would be learning to take the opposite sort of attitude genuinely in the other way.  For extraverts, seeing something beyond winning at the game in a way that everyone can see.  For introverts, learning to take winning at the game seriously enough to defend your worldly interests.
