The [[Myers Briggs]] world seems to have a [[Definition Problem]].  It's far from clear that any two people are using the same letters and words to stand for the same things.  What's more, most don't seem to notice.

People merrily "type" famous people by giving them four-letter codes.  Different people come up with different codes.  They don't resolve this by tracing the different interpretation to different observations about the person, nor to differences between the distinctions they have in mind.  They just say "no, you are wrong."  They seem to assume that the letters and words have meanings that others share.
