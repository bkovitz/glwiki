We use the term ''Lenore-attitude'' to designate exactly which terminology we're using.  A Lenore-attitude is a [[function attitude]], using the concepts and terminology of [[Lenore Thomson]].

= Why we need this term =

People in the [[Myers-Briggs]] world often use the same terminology to mean very different things, all of which tend to be pretty fuzzily defined.  For example, [[Linda Berens]] speaks of "[[function-attitude]]s" that seem a lot more like an attempt to catalog all the kinds of mental things you can do consciously.  For example, [[Linda Berens]] defines Si as remembering the past, Ni as thinking of the future, and Se as attending to the present concrete situation.  [[Lenore]]'s concepts are somewhat harder to pin down, indeed the whole purpose of this wiki is to figure out what she's talking about, but the basic idea seems to be quite different.

If we understand [[Lenore]] correctly, Lenore-attitudes are different innate "molds" into which the brain pours its sensory experiences, each Lenore-attitude structuring the same experience differently and regarding different aspects of the same experience as meaningful and meaningless.  They relate only somewhat obliquely to personality, in that Lenore-attitudes provide people's ways of navigating through both the inner world of [[archetypes]] and the outer world of material concerns and social status--the process of [[ego-orientation]].

Often people in the [[Meyers-Briggs]] world use the same terminology to stand for radically different things without saying so, and perhaps without knowing that they talking in terms of completely different hypotheses.

So when we want to indicate with maximum clarity that we mean "whatever [[Lenore Thomson]] is talking about when she speaks of [[function attitude]]s," we say "Lenore-attitudes".

= From the perspective of [[Introverted Intuition]], this term might be superfluous =

From a radically Ni perspective, distinguishing between what Lenore means by [[function attitude]] terminology and what other people mean by the same terminology might seem misguided.  From an Ni perspective, words don't ''refer to'' anything; rather, they shape the way you take in and make sense of information.  No one person's way of interpreting experience has any privilege over any other.  What matters are the words themselves; each person must be free to make his own interpretation.

So, by even using making the distinction of Lenore-attitudes vs. what other people use [[function attitude]] terminology to stand for, we might be privileging some Lenore-attitudes over others.  Specifically, we might be discounting [[introverted intuition]] in favor of [[introverted thinking]].  Nevertheless, we are not going to let that stop us.

[[Lenore]] herself, being a dom-Ni type, might even see this attempt to clarify terminology as misguided.  We are not even going to let ''that'' stop us.
