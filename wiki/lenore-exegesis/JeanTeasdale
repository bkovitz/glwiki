= ISFJ or INTP? =

Interesting puzzle here, maybe able to shed a lot of light on [[Lenore]]'s ideas about [[function attitude]]s and [[psychological type]]s.

ISFJ seesm like the obvious guess: endlessly concerned with Fe demonstrations of where one stands, but stuck in a bizarre, quirky set of idiosyncratic ways of understanding the social vocabulary (Si) baffled that no one else is in sync with it.

However, I know two women in person who are remarkably similar to Jean Teasdale.  One of them even married a boor who sounds a lot like Hubby Rick.  And both of these women came out INTP on the [[Myers-Briggs]] test.  -- [[Ben Kovitz]]
