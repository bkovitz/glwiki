Or, in the [[Game-Board Exegesis]], a person's "type" would be a person's primary and secondary ways of defining "I" in relation to the game board.

We can take any [[function attitude]] we like, but the [[function attitude]] that we follow to create a sense of self is to some considerable extent creating us.  It's defining our conscious perspective, our understanding of who "I" am and what "I" care about and why "I" am doing what I'm doing.

''Te:'' What are ''my'' goals, ''my'' criteria of progress and success?  How shall ''I'' constrain constrain affairs to ensure that those goals come about?

''Ti:'' ''I'' must understand for ''myself'' based on reasoning that ''I'' can grasp first-hand.  ''I'' will have to play around with it ''myself'' so that ''I'' "get it".

''Fe:'' What network of obligations am ''I'' bound into?  How will this affect or define ''my'' relationships with other people?

''Fi:'' What is alive here and what are its needs, as ''I'' understand it through first-hand empathy, and what does it call upon ''me'' to do?

''Se:'' What is ''my'' gut reaction right now?  What impulse do ''I'' feel like following right this second?  What image shall ''I'' create (what gut reaction shall ''I'' produce in others)?

''Si:'' What enduring thing am ''I'' anchored to?  What can ''I'' find by knowing to look for it?  What can ''I'' depend on in a world that is mostly unknown and changing?

''Ne:'' How can ''I'' change the game?  How can ''I'' open up the unknown and thereby change the meaning of what's before us right now?

''Ni:'' What is ''my own'' way of seeing things, independent of influences such as other people's music, other people's ideas, other people's expectations, my culture, my language, or reality itself?

Relentlessly asking and answering these questions, we form an ego.  We eventually believe that the "I" of one of these sentences is what we are, and any other "I" is a threat to our very integrity as a person.

Learning about [[function attitude]]s widens our conscious perspective so that we no longer understand ourselves solely in terms of one of these.  When different [[function attitude]]s no longer seem like a threat, we can call widely upon our talents and still maintain personal integrity.
