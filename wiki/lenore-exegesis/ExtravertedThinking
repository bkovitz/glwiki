= A proposed definition =

Hypothesis: Extraverted Thinking is the attitude of viewing the world through measurable criteria for choosing different responses.

For example, you might specify to a sporting-goods shop that your tennis racket be strung to between 55 and 57 pounds.  If you measure it and it's not within those parameters, you send it back; if it is within those parameters, you accept it and pay the amount specified in the contract.

From the Te perspective, anything for which you can't give an operational definition in terms of measurement (an "objective test") doesn't exist.  The decision criteria are defined not exactly in terms of the things: they're defined in terms of observations of a sort that anyone can do and get the same result.  You put the totality of the real-world situation onto your scales, so that ''all'' causal factors come into play--both known and unknown.  What's accessible to you is the reading on the scale: that and only that is the basis for your decision.

As a [[dominant function]], Te typically leads one to pursue and collect ''reliable'' ways of making decisions to get predictable results.  The repeatability of a process becomes one of the main criteria for finding it valuable.  Repeatable processes are valuable from a Te perspective because they enable you to make ''agreements'' with other people, where there is no doubt as to whether each party has fulfilled its part of the agreement.  Making and delivering on promises is often a Te attitude leads one to understand ethics.

The statue of the blind woman holding a balance scale, to symbolize justice, might be one of the clearest symbols of the Te attitude.  

[[Steven Covey]] is no doubt one of the leading exponents of the [[extraverted thinking]] attitude toward life, though partly leavened by an alternative viewpoint of [[introverted intuition]].

''Hypothesis:'' Extraverted Thinking is the attitude of viewing the world through measurable criteria for choosing different responses.  Both the criteria and the possible decisions are defined in advance of making the decision.  In Extraverted Thinking, there is always a definite space of possibilities--all the possible measurements--and a defined cleavage of that space into regions that correspond to different responses.

For example, you might specify to a sporting-goods shop that your tennis racket be strung to a tension between 55 and 57 pounds.  If you measure it and it's not within those parameters, you send it back; if it is within those parameters, you accept it and pay the amount specified in the contract.  The "space" is string tension on the racket.  It's cleaved into three regions that correspond to distinct responses: 55-57 lbs. maps to "accept"; less than 55 lbs. maps to "reject"; and more than 57 lbs. maps to "reject".
