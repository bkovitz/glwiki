= Example: the Shy [[INTP]] =

Here is one way the [[Tertiary Temptation]] might affect an [[INTP]].

Due to having Ti as his [[dominant function]], the [[INTP]] tends to live introspectively, engaged in introverted activities that allow him to ponder the causal order of the universe. However, at some point in his life, his inferior Fe will cause him to desire to interact with others and change his standing with them. For example, he might get tired of being seen as a "nerd" or a "geek." Or he may want people to acknowledge his intelligence and listen to all his interesting ideas. However, his inferior Fe is too weak to engage in the social games that people play, so it cannot fulfill its goals under its own steam. He will be frustrated that people seem to assign status based on Fe and Se values such as popularity and "coolness," because these appear illogical and irrelevant from the standpoint of Ti.

Dominant Ti alone cannot solve the INTP's social difficulties; in fact, it leads the [[INTP]] to turn up his nose at the seemingly idiotic social world. He will claim that he doesn't ''know how'' to socialize ("knowing how" is usually a tipoff of Ti). Tertiary Si will affirm this attitude, by convincing the [[INTP]] that trying to socialize would surely end in disaster, because he doesn't have any kind of roadmap to navigate the arbitrary social world with. Or maybe his Ti will lead him to take a highly judgmental attitude that people ''just don't work the way they should.'' From the standpoint of the disgruntled [[INTP]], people are too weak, clingy, and emotional, with no stomach for the '''truth'''. He will tell you all the ways in which the current social system is dysfunctional, and how should it be resigned to fit some better underlying principles (see [[Saint-and-Politicians Exegesis]] for reasons why introverts often take attitudes like this). In this case, his Si will tempt him into only associating with people he feels safe with, and who won't challenge his overly introverted attitude. He will think "most people have absolutely no clue, so I need to find the few people who do and stick with them."

In short, his Ti and Si keep him [[semiotically disoriented]] and unable to relate to the extraverted social world.

Without Ne, the [[INTP]] will believe that he will be totally lost (Si) in the social world, because he doesn't understand ''how it works'' (Ti). Even when he tries to socialize in this mindset, he will feel he never has anything to say. This feeling of helplessness and "analysis paralysis" is due to his semiotic disorientation. When he does say something, he will be careful not to rock the boat (Si), because he feels he doesn't ''know how'' to socialize (Ti), and wants to hide this fact from others to avoid incurring a negative reputation (inferior Fe). For instance, he might take on the role of a "nice guy" to avoid the stigma of "nerd." Ironically, such fear to express his personality might make others believe he is boring and antisocial, and contribute to the negative reputation he developed in the first place! In the end, he will fall back on the areas of life where he "knows what he is doing." These areas will usually be his old introverted activities, so he is back to square one.

To summarize, Fe goals tend to get the INTP's Ti/Si into a [[semiotically disoriented]] muddle that leaves him no method of relating to the task at hand.

'''Enter: [[Extraverted Intuition]]'''
 
Ne offers the [[INTP]] another perspective that can help with his social difficulties. It will encourage him to improvise, experiment, and attune himself to the world of possibilities in social interaction. He will be witty, unique, and say whatever nobody else thought of. Furthermore, through his Ne creativity and experimentation, his Ti will be able to able to figure out the underlying principles behind socializing. Thus, the Ti is brought back on board and has a way to constructively relate to the task. 
   
When the Ti manifests itself to help an [[INTP]] figure out how people tick, it is helping him meet his Fe goals. Fundamentally, Ne frames the social world as a place of exciting new possibilities just waiting to be understood, providing the Ti with a way of semiotically [[orienting]] itself to those goals.

Contrast the hyper-introverted attitudes of Ti + Se with the more extraverted attitudes of Ti + Ne. 

''Ti + Si:'' "I don't know how people work, so I need to be very careful because I can't predict how they are going to behave"

''Ti + Ne:'' "Maybe I don't know how people work ''yet,'' but if I just improvise and try new things, I will be able to figure it out!" 

''Ti + Si:'' "Most people have no clue how the universe works, so I need to stick with the few who do"

''Ti + Ne:'' "There is something interesting I can learn from everyone potentially; I just need to figure out what."

With this analysis in mind, it is easy to see how the [[tertiary temptation]] affects [[INFP]]s also (this might happen when the Te pressures the [[INFP]] to stop dreaming and get some results). 

''Fi + Si:'' "I must proceed cautiously into the unknown, or I will mess up and feel like crap."'' 

''Fi + Ne:'' "I will just improvise until I find an approach that I can feel good about!''

== Can the Dominant and Inferior Functions live in harmony? ==

This leads to the interesting idea that perhaps the [[dominant function]] and the [[inferior function]] can be friends after all when the [[secondary function]] allows them to join hands. Most of the clashes between your dominant and inferior functions occur because the childish needs of the [[inferior function]] tend to cause you to become [[semiotically disoriented]]. However, if you can use your [[secondary function]] to re-orient yourself, then maybe these clashes need not be so bad.

Here is one way the [[Tertiary Temptation]] might affect [[INTPs]].
@@d32
@@i33
Due to having Ti as his [[dominant function]], the INTP tends to live introspectively, engaged in introverted activities that allow him to ponder the causal order of the universe. However, at some point in his life, his inferior Fe will cause him to desire to interact with others and change his standing with them. For example, he might get tired of being seen as a "nerd" or a "geek." Or he may want people to acknowledge his intelligence and listen to all his interesting ideas. However, his inferior Fe is too weak to engage in the social games that people play, so it cannot fulfill its goals under its own steam. He will be frustrated that people seem to assign status based on Fe and Se values such as popularity and "coolness," because these appear illogical and irrelevant from the standpoint of Ti.

Dominant Ti alone cannot solve the INTP's social difficulties; in fact, it leads the INTP to turn up his nose at the seemingly idiotic social world. He will claim that he doesn't ''know how'' to socialize ("knowing how" is usually a tipoff of Ti). Tertiary Si will affirm this attitude, by convincing the INTP that trying to socialize would surely end in disaster, because he doesn't have any kind of roadmap to navigate the arbitrary social world with. Or maybe his Ti will lead him to take a highly judgmental attitude that people ''just don't work the way they should.'' From the standpoint of the disgruntled INTP, people are too weak, clingy, and emotional, with no stomach for the '''truth'''.

Contrast the hyper-[[introverted]] attitudes of Ti + Si  with the more [[extraverted]] attitudes of Ti + Ne. "I need to stay in control of everything to be sure it comes out right" vs. "I'll take my chances in the wider world and deal with whatever comes up":

People will have no choice but to deal with it.  They'll want to deal with it because it relates to their existing interests.

This leads to the interesting idea that perhaps the [[dominant function]] and the [[inferior function]] can be friends after all when the [[secondary function]] allows them to join hands. Most of the clashes between your dominant and inferior functions occur because the childish needs of the [[inferior function]] cause you to become [[semiotically disoriented]]. However, if you can use your [[secondary function]] to re-orient yourself, then maybe these clashes need not be so bad. See [[Developing a Function]].

Ne, as a way to expand outward into the world rather than as a way to gather fuel for more Ti analysis, leads you to "plant seeds" of potential: to add something new to what's going on that opens up the potential for something not entirely known to happen--but something where there are real stakes.  It leads you to choose your seeds to fit the existing social arena, and to collect tangible winnings when a seed bears fruit.
