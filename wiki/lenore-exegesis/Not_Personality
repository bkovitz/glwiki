There seems to be a great deal to personality that [[Lenore]] doesn't talk about.

= Hypothesis: It's not about personality =

What dimensions of personality are there?  What words describe personality?

Calm, high-strung, resilient, sharp-tongued, epicurean, libertine, cautious, melancholic, choleric, sanguine, phlegmatic, peaceful, pushy, a pushover, ethereal, pragmatic, affable, cranky, crusty, curmudgeonly, scientific, curious, gullible, skeptical, free-thinking, conformist, playful, serious, rabble-rousing, hedonistic, idealistic, loud, quiet, wise, patient, impatient, intellectual, thorough, diligent, tentative, know-it-all, loose, sex-crazed, attention-grabbing, achievement-oriented, cat person, dog person, keeps it all bottled up, anal-retentive, anal-expulsive, studious, glib, stick-to-it-ive, and probably hundreds more.

[[Lenore's]] concepts of [[Function Attitudes]] and the ideas in the [[Main Propositions]] have almost nothing to do with any of this.

Indeed, on discussion lists, [[Lenore]] has mentioned that people come out with different four-letter codes in terms of her system than in [[David Keirsey]]'s system.  For example, Keirsey gives Ronald Reagan ESFP while [[Lenore]] gives him ENFJ.

So we propose that [[Lenore]] is not talking about personality types--despite the title of her book!  She's talking about one very thin sliver of the totality of personality: which of a set of "meaning filters" you tend to see yourself and your experiences through.  There is no contradiction between pretty much any personality-describing term and a [[Lenore]]-four-letter code.  For example, there can be calm ISTJs as well as high-strung ESTJs.

This should hardly come as a surprise.  There are only 16 four-letter codes, and we all know how extraordinarily rich and varied people are.

[[Lenore's]] [[Main Propositions]] and [[Function Attitudes]] have almost nothing to do with any of this.  In [[Lenore]]'s writing, there is seldom even a mention of typical personality words.
@@i16

Furthermore, everyone actually has ''all'' of the above attributes--potentially if not occasionally.  If you are an idealistic person, you are probably also pragmatic in some ways.  If you are quiet most of the time, there are probably times when you are loud.  The most trustful person is no doubt capable of the most extreme degrees of suspiciousness.

Something that we like about [[Lenore]]'s writing is that it allows people to have their real complexity, including--especially including--their ability to have opposite attributes.  [[Lenore]]'s main idea is not to fit people into simple categories of behavior, but to describe ways in which people cut themselves off from and regain access to the full spectrum of ways of thinking and behaving.
