[[Lenore]] doesn't offer a bunch of categories to say that some people are inherently this way and other people are inherently that way, and you've got to fit in one box or another.

What [[Lenore]] offers is a way to see your current way of understanding your personality as a way in which you've limited yourself in order to serve various needs.  She offers a way to see your current understanding of your personality as an illusion.  More importantly, she offers a vocabulary of different [[attitudes]] that lead beyond it, to a fuller realization of your genuine self in your real life and circumstances.

This makes [[Lenore]]'s ideas unhearable in terms of most approaches to understanding personality.  What most people are looking for when they get a book on personality, especially one with a name like ''Personality Type: An Owner's Manual,'' is something to say, with authority, "This is the kind of person you are.  Anyone who tells you to be different is wrong.  Science has shown that there are these kinds of people and those kinds of people, and you are this kind of person."  What [[Lenore]] offers is exactly ''not'' that.  

But [[Lenore]] isn't telling you to be different, either.  She offers some ideas for how to truly be yourself, without the limitations of any particular theory of personality.

== What it's not ==

[[Lenore]] doesn't offer a bunch of categories to say that some people are inherently this way and other people are inherently that way.  She offers no taxonomy of different kinds of talents, nor different kinds of callings, nor different kinds of environments that people need in order to flour, nor [[Gifts Differing]] of any sort.  She uses the terms "[[Extraverted]]" and "[[Introverted]]" to mean something completely unrelated to whether you're gregarious or reserved.

== What it is ==
@@i5
The vocabulary doesn't point you to some distant place where you're supposedly heading.  It aims to help you direct your attention in some way that is fruitful now, giving your current situation and your current understanding of yourself.  The vocabulary focuses on the kinds of needs that have shaped your personality so far and particular ways of directing your attention to those needs that have grown into your characteristic way of understanding and nevigating your situation.
