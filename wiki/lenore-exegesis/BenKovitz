If you're enjoying this wiki (or if you hate it), please post here or send me an email!  I'd love to hear from anyone else who's found Lenore's stuff fascinating.

The February 2003 issue of [[Cutter IT Journal http://www.cutter.com/itjournal/toc.html]] printed a somewhat Lenore-inspired article I wrote about [[Extreme Programming http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices]], titled "XP and the Cognitive Divide".

'''How I got into this'''

I originally got interested in Myers-Briggs in 1997 when I read [[Joe Butt's on-line type profiles http://www.typelogic.com]].  The distinction between Te and Ti seemed to mirror a topic that I'd been pursuing for many years: different aspects of logic and different rhetorical styles.  One form of logic or rhetoric holds a conceptual framework or space of possibilities constant and applies it to concrete reality via measurement and deduction.  The other starts with raw experience and forms it into conceptual spaces which are always fluid and waiting to have possibilities added or removed to better fit the potentialities found in concrete reality.  The implicit rules of these two ways of understanding logic are quite incompatible and lead to strange disagreements and misunderstandings.  These seem to be exactly the sorts of disagreements that are typical between INTJs and INTPs.

I went back and forth for quite a long time on whether the Jungian or Lenorean function-attitudes refer to the same thing and possibly extend the vocabulary to include much more.  Well, I still go back and forth about that.  I was particularly disappointed by the [[Definition Problem]] on psych-type--or rather, by the obliviousness to it.  It sometimes seems to me that no two people in the [[Myers Briggs]] world are using the letters to stand for the same things, and yet they don't notice.  In 1999, just about to give up on the notion of Jungian functions, I got a copy of 
[[Personality Type: An Owner's Manual http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0877739870]] at the suggestion of [[Robbie Geary]].  Being only a self-help book, it doesn't supply the rigor I'm hoping to find, but I found its observations of people and hints of a theory intriguing.

[[Lenore Thomson]]'s stuff seems to me to suggest a possible unity among a tremendous number of seemingly irreconcilable philosophical theories and disagreements going back to ancient Greece: a vocabulary for describing the worldviews and ultimate assumptions that make those theories simultaneously inescapable and irreconcilable.

* An analysis of personal-transformation seminars like the [[Landmark Forum]], NLP, and [[Anthony Robbins]] as preaching ENTJ attitudes, often in ways not appropriate for people of other types.  "Be an ENTJ" requires some pretty massive rewiring if you're not already on that path.  Also, the heavy-handed Ni preaching is done from a heavily [[Extraverted]] point of view.  The costs and benefits of that are probably very interesting.

On a related note, Woody Allen's humor might be an example of INTP humor. The Ti is definitely visible. He takes normal ideas to their absurd conclusion, or he juxtaposes normal things to create weird unexpected combinations. 

Perhaps we need a page on how humor varies between the types.

Monty Python strikes me as yet another variation, as a different kind of humor. Perhaps this is again ISTP. There is a distinct S flavor to it. Help me explain this and to explore the distinctions.

I went back and forth for quite a long time on whether the Jungian or Lenorean function-attitudes refer to the same thing and possibly extend the vocabulary to include much more.  Well, I still go back and forth about that.  I was particularly disappointed by the [[Definition Problem]] on psych-type--or rather, by the obliviousness to it.  It sometimes seems to me that no two people in the [[Myers-Briggs]] world are using the letters to stand for the same things, and yet they don't notice.  In 1999, just about to give up on the notion of Jungian functions, I got a copy of [[Personality Type: An Owner's Manual http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0877739870/ref=greenlightwik-20]] at the suggestion of Robbie Geary.  Being only a self-help book, it doesn't supply the rigor I'm hoping to find, but I found its observations of people and hints of a theory intriguing.

Visualized with a picture where each [[function attitude]] builds downward from the surface to water below.  Unacknowledged aspects of the self find other ways to get through, like lava coming to the surface.

* [[Camille Paglia]] seems to me to be an extremely [[Lenore]]-like INTJ.  Paglia proposes that pop culture is the vehicle through which the Dionysian spirit undermines the Apollonian.  She sometimes seems to side with the Dionysian, but really she takes a [[Parliament of Attitudes]] view that the clash between these opposing ways of finding meaning is what keeps life going.  She seems to be an Ni spokesman for Se: a commenter-on, an Se-wannabee, not herself a participant.  She uses the word "chthonic" a lot, perhaps a bit like [[Lenore]] uses "numinous".  I once asked [[Lenore]] if she was [[Camille Paglia]], but she said no.  Not sure whether to believe her.
