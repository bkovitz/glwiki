p. 41: "When we use [[Feeling]] in an [[Introverted]] way, it operates as a kind of inner flame--a sense of personal values that may be difficult to explain or express directly but whose character informs our choices and inclinations."

p. 366: "Introverted Feeling ... encourages a ''personal'' relationship to an evolving pattern, a will to gauge the situation by an experiential ideal.  For example, if we use Introverted Feeling to make a good spaghetti sauce, we won't follow recipes or measure ingredients.  We'll sample the sauce as we're making it, gauging its taste, smell, and texture by their ideal outcome and adjusting for circumstantial variables so the emerging pattern stays on track."

p. 367: "To invoke Introverted Feeling, we have to ''know'' the difference between a good outcome and a bad one--know with our senses, in our bones (on the basis of living, breathing, first-hand experience)."

p. 370: "[[Introverted Feeling]] relies on the inward, right-brain criteria of experience and empathy to mark off decisions that go beyond our roles in society to affect us as human beings.  Law and custom, after all, are the lowest common denominator of a defined community.  We associate character and humane behavior with the moral imperatives shaped by inner values."

p. 371: "An inner point of reference, one trained by personal experience.  (Bypassing matters of social standing) to focus on the quintessentially human."

= A proposed definition =

[[Introverted Feeling]] (Fi) is the attitude that everything that is manifest (apparent, observable, described) is the expression of a soul or life force, in terms of which everything ultimately makes sense.  Each living thing is completely unique, and needing to express itself and grow in its unique way.  None of this can be put into categories or measurements, at least not without blotting out that utter uniqueness of each living thing.  Because we are all living things, even though each of us is unique we can still connect to the life force as it exists in others.  From an Fi standpoint, the way to respond to things is in a way that is faithful to that underlying life force.

= Proposed definition #2 =

[[Introverted Feeling]] (Fi) is the attitude of judging things good or bad based on how they harmonize or clash with a living being's inner essence.  That inner essence or soul, and how things in the environment get along with it or conflict with it, is knowable only first-hand.  It is known by attending to one's own emotions in response to things.  What you like is good--for you, not necessarily good for others.  What you don't like is bad--for you, not necessarily bad for others.

= As a language of [[Ego Orientation]] =

As a [[Dominant Function]], Fi leads IFPs to live a life based on empathy and harmony between self and others--and/or to see life as a never-ending conflict between souls that are intrinsically different and opposed.  ISFPs typically seek out a space in which they can be completely and spontaneously themselves, following their artistic impulses without regard to social expectation or definition of any sort.  Some do their best to live life as a soap opera: creating and living out intense drama wherever they go.  INFPs typically seek to ''understand'' the world in terms of drama, emotion, and people seeking their own unique callings (perhaps [[Garrison Keillor]] is a good example of that).  Some, like [[John Gray]], attempt to help others understand each other through empathy with each other's differences, and thereby find peace and synergy.

As a [[Secondary Function]], Fi typically leads EFPs to tune into the unmet needs and callings of others--as an avenue to making a sale, as a way to intuit what would entertain people, as a channel to political gain by demonstrating that you understand people's pain (e.g. [[Bill Clinton]]), as a way to chart a course through life based on a calling felt to be unique to them.  Sometimes it leads them to sense a higher calling to answer to, a sense that their actions have cosmic meaning by virtue of how they aid or hinder life.

As a [[Tertiary Function]], Fi typically leads ITJs to retreat into solitary actions that have no constructive worldly effect but are aimed at providing a seemingly rational basis for calling themselves good people.  Another example is obsession with the purity of one's soul.  For example, being a vegetarian while working at Taco Bell--not out of any great love for animals (the person might hardly know anything about what cows are like), but to be able to say, "Well, at least ''I'' never ate any animals.''  Or engaging in pointless acts of honor, like maintaining super-self-control or going down with the ship.  Nothing is gained by going down with the ship; it's a hyper-[[introverted]] act aimed at providing a rationalization for one's goodness without regard to real-world consequences.  Nearly all of these tertiary-Fi acts involve ''refraining'' from action viewed as unethical rather than taking positive action that would accomplish something.  They're a retreat from the world--or rather, a rationalization for disregarding worldly matters.

As an [[Inferior Function]], Fi typically leads ETJs to acts of self-destructive hedonism, creation of opera-like drama in their lives and the lives of those around them, and bizarre solitary acts of atonement for the harms they've done to others.  Sometimes inferior-Fi leads ETJs to preach and even practice a sort of hyper-selfishness, e.g. [[Ayn Rand]] and the [[Landmark Forum]].

Naturally, you can see plenty of dominant-style Fi in ETJs, secondary-style Fi in IFPs, and so on--eve inferior-style Fi in IFPs.

Tertiary and inferior Fi also sometimes lead TJs to view large numbers of people as "troglodytes": soulless or stupid creatures whose rotten situations in life derive only from their own intrinsic rottenness-of-soul.  To take a comic example, [[Lex Luthor]]'s lamentation in ''Superman'', "Why is the world's greatest criminal genius surrounded by nincompoops?"
