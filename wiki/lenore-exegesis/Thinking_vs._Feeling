Feelers "feel" the importance of something based on the "weight" of their emotions regarding it. Thinkers would rather figure out the importance via logic or "sense."

But since this still has some confusion among several people, it's obvious that the above explanation has gotten us nowhere. Let's refill the gas tank and see if we can keep driving. (Yup, Ne.)

Time for an example for the Sensors out there who have actually put up this far with the theory.

A Ti dominant user and an Fi dominant user are in a chat room.

Fi: I wish I could say this stuff in person--text is so impersonal. But if I were saying this to you in real life, I would be crying my eyes out.
Ti: What do you mean?! I'm already crying my eyes out! What's wrong with text?

Fi is more dependent on the "real-life," emotional, body-language/facial expression ways of communication: the things that are hard or impossible to quantify but which are obvious to Fi Feelers. They're seeing and hearing not what you say, but instead how you say it. They pay attention to your emotions.

Ti is more dependent on clear terms and words to receive and understand the meaning. They're listening to what you say, and trying to figure out if it makes any sense. They can be affected by emotions, but they have to be emotions with reasons behind them to make any impact. Body language? What body language?

A Te general and an Fe general are trying to figure out what to do.

Te: Let's move this group over here. They're just big enough to attack their party.
Fe: Are you kidding me?! Half of them will get killed!
Te: They'll get the task done. Do you want to end this war quickly or not? Sending more will take too much time and too many resources.
Fe: But they'll get killed!
Te: (sarcastically) Or we could send another group to help, take up hours, compromise our plans to go after the other enemy party, and possibly risk an attack from the very soldiers we're plotting to kill with the first, losing our first-attack advantage.
Fe: Yes, let's do that.
Te: *headdesk*

Yes, this is a bad example, because Fe people (and Feelers in general) probably won't apply for an Army position.

Te people are concerned with what will get the task ''done'' and what will get their goal ''accomplished''. The task comes first, and once the task is done, the people are taken care of.

Fe people are concerned with the community and the good of the people around them, but can put tasks off to the last minute, which can be extremely dangerous in certain situations... like the above.
