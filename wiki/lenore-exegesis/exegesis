The word is most commonly applied to the study of texts like the Bible or Aristotle's treatises.  These texts use a lot of words and concepts that are not familiar to modern readers, and assume a lot of knowledge of their readers that few people possess today.

These texts use a lot of words and concepts that are not familiar to modern readers, and assume a lot of knowledge of their readers that few people possess today.  Consequently, to understand them today, you need some help: someone to tell you the things the authors of those texts assumed of their readers, what the main controversies of the day were, etc.
