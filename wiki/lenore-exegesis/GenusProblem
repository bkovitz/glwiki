The ''genus problem'' is the difficulty in telling what sorts of things the attitudes are (as well as types, functions, and pretty much all concepts in the Jungian/Myers-Briggs world).

* Possibly a deeper analysis of the meaning-filters concept is that each function is a collection of archetypes.  A function-attitude is an extraverted or introverted way of applying a collection of archetypes to the specifics of your own life.  Archetypes are innate ways of structuring experience: for example, seeing the world in terms of numbers (number is an archetype) or in terms of heroes vs. villains.

* An alternate deeper analysis of meaning-filters is that all the functions tap into the same collection of archetypes but according to different patterns.  On this interpretation, irrational functions might bring archetypes to life without regard for connection or relation between them; while rational attitudes bring archetypes to life by following overlaps between applications of them (like syllogisms).

'''What is a genus?'''

A ''genus'' is the part of a definition that tells the underlying kind of thing, or "substance", of which the thing being defined is one variety.  The other part of a definition is called the ''differentia:'' the way in which the thing being defined is being distinguished from others of its genus for purposes of the definition.  (The plural of genus is ''genera''.)

For example, a pen is a writing instrument that fits the hand and writes a line by dispensing ink when moved along the page.  It's distinguished from pencils and other writing instruments, like brushes, by the way the material that forms the line comes out.

Usually, the genera of the concepts we use is obvious and goes without saying.  Sometimes, though, you have a certain feeling of deep confusion or misunderstanding.  It's hard to put your finger on what the problem is, because you have no concepts with which to frame a question.  The trouble is that you don't know the genus.  Imagine your confusion if you knew the differentia but not the genus of "pen".  Is a pen a person who writes with ink?  A publisher?  An author?  A movement of people who together are mightier than a sword?

That type of confusion is what many of us feel in regard to the functions and attitudes.  The types of disagreements where people seem to be talking past each other, which are common in the Myers-Briggs world, suggest that they don't have the same implicit understanding of the genera of their concepts.
