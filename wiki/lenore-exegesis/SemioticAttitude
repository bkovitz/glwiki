What [[Lenore]] might have in mind by Se, Si, Ne, Ni, Te, Ti, Fe, and Fi is different ways of understanding how signs relate to meanings--or rather, "what signs mean".

----
'''Signs and meanings'''

What we mean here by a ''sign'' is: anything that you can observe; anything that you could possibly interpret.

What we mean by a ''meaning'' is: whatever you understand a sign as indicating, standing for, pointing to, etc; any interpretation that you give a sign.

For example, a word is a sign.  Dictionaries try to document what words mean.

A cloud is a sign: a cloud can be a sign that it will rain soon.  In this case, the rain is the meaning.

If a person's eye twitches, that's a sign: a sign that that person is nervous.

----
'''Attitudes toward signs and meanings'''

The idea, then, is that each of those Lenore-attitudes is a way in which you can attach a meaning to a sign--or even a condition that you need satisfied or else you view the sign as "meaningless".

Vast amounts of philosophical writing have been devoted to arguing that other people's ways of interpreting signs are "meaningless".  For example, the [[Logical Positivist]] movement tried to show that a proposition is meaningless unless there is an empirical test to see if it's true; some even said that the meaning ''is'' that empirical test.  [[William Blake]] spoke of seeing a "world in a grain of sand": a radically different way of finding meaning in things.  [[Joe Friday]] wanted "just the facts": when someone told him interpretations that he didn't think were reliable, he tried to sift out all but the meanings he could use as a solid basis for making decisions according to the law.

On the exegesis proposed here, what Lenore has done is come up with a set of [[Semiotic Attitudes]] that people depend on as a way of [[Orienting]] themselves in life.  Each, used on its own as a way to find meaning in life, leads you to carve out a life for yourself but also eventually gets you into trouble that you can't get out of by continuing to orient yourself with that attitude.  Each [[Semiotic Attitude]] has opposing attitudes that nullify it: opposite attitudes each call the other's ways of understanding things "meaningless".  But there are other, more complementary relations between different [[Semiotic Attitudes]].

Lenore's stuff, then, would be a conceptual vocabulary for consciously shifting between [[Semiotic Attitudes]] and also understanding [[RhetoricalClash]]es between people's attempts to persuade, understand, and be understood by others.

See [[Semiotic Attitudes]] for an attempt to list and summarize all eight.
