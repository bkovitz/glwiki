'''Explanation of a [[Rhetorical Clash]]?'''

Perhaps that explains a peculiarity in the way that some types, especially INFJs, often respond to the rhetoric of INTPs.

Here's the phenomenon:  The INTP presents an idea, developed by comparing and contrasting various things to "bring out" some possible causal factor at work--the [[Holistic Spiraling]] style.  The INFJ responds by accusing the INTP of trying to set him- or herself up as an authority that everyone else must obey, and announcing that the INFJ refuses to do so.  Other types do this, too, of course: FJs of all stripes, and ISPs.

This would be explained by the "no fixed reference points" of [[Introverted Perception]] because the INTP is concerned primarily with establishing deeper and deeper reference points in reality.  From the INTP's standpoint, the choice to settle on these reference points rather than others must grow out of the concrete reality itself.  The INTP tries to be helpful by pointing them out: "Look over here, now look over there, do you see the pattern yet?"

The INFJ, however, understands choice of shared reference points to be a matter of negotiation: a choice of reference points always serves some interests rather than others.  "Why should I use reference points that serve your purposes rather than mine?  This is really something to decide collectively, so that everyone's interests are served fairly."

The INTP refuses to negotiate, because from the [[Introverted Thinking]] perspective, understanding things is not a matter of negotiation, it's just between you and the concrete reality.  The INFJ perceives the refusal to negotiate as an attempt to bully, or negotiate heavy-handedly--an attempt with no force behind it, therefore easy to ignore.

This exegesis is perhaps tainted because it grows out of my frustrations with IJs, but it might shed some light on the above conundrum:

Perhaps from the standpoint of [[Introverted Perception]], you try to look at things as if they were being told to you over the phone, without your having any other access to them than that.

Being given only representations of things, not the things-in-themselves (echoes of [[Immanuel Kant]] here), naturally you suspect their veracity.  The source of the representations no doubt skews them in some way, so they reflect more than just what they describe.  For all you know, the representations are a complete fiction.

I sense, in IJs, a need to "stabilize" things before making any judgements about them.  That stabilization would take the form of casting the facts and criteria of the matter into some kind of representation.  The reality itself seems too complex to address directly; the representation can be held in the mind and explored systematically.

= A proposed definition: categorization without criteria =

Introverted Perception is the attitude of putting things you experience into categories, where the categories are chosen on the basis of whatever seems to you to fit the things, and without regard for any defined purpose or criteria.

Taking an Si perspective, then, you simply find categories to put things in, and use these categories to build a rich network of mental associations that guide you to attend to the things that matter to you--to find those things in the midst of a predominantly overwhelming perceptual field.

Taking an Ni perspective, you attend to the limits of whatever categories you come across: what is left out of them, what (probably unstated) purposes are served by those categories, what exists but cannot be said in terms of those categories.

Si leads you to gradually accumulate a factual map of the world, or at least the parts of it that are of interest to you.  Ni leads you to gradually accumulate an understanding of how different maps operate and to be able to compare the assumptions of different maps against each other.

I think you're somewhat on the right track. The INJ says to the NP: How can you even begin to draw conjectures from these particular representations of reality when you don't even know if they're representing reality correctly? Don't you know that they don't reveal ''reality'', they reveal the author's bias?

So "no fixed reference points" doesn't mean that experience is a jumble. It means that there aren't any objectively true assumptions you can make, like the NP uses to build his hypothesising upon. They look at the mental model the NPs are getting into such an excited tizzy over and see a house built on sand.

I basically see in INJs a dread of ever falling prey to bias. Therefore they will reject anything that smells of it in the slightest.

''Alternate hypothesis: it's not an inflexible stand, it's a sense of being in a [[Yawning Void http://greenlightwiki/heuristic/YawningVoid]], where you are presented with nothing but ''signs'' and no reality.  Instead of following the [[Holistic Spiraling]] rhetoric of an NP, perhaps most INJs insist on first understanding exactly what the signs are that are being interpreted, and what the rules are for interpreting them.  NPs don't give you that, since they don't look at reality by referring it to some known set of interpretations; they go the other way around, letting concrete reality be their guide.  The INJ argument often boils down to: "Why should I believe your interpretation and not some other one?"  The NP answer is: "Weren't you paying attention to all the neat stuff I just pointed out?"''

Well, let's see...perhaps from a rational attitude, one would expect a reason, and from an irrational attitude one wouldn't! ;)  Seriously, this is an interesting observation, one that this INTP has also made.  One possible explanation is that switching between [[Extraverted]] and [[Introverted]] forms of the same function might be easy, if it's your [[Dominant Function]].  Another possible explanation is that the real common "language" might be determined more by function than by attitude.  I'd love to see more observations and ideas about this.  --[[Ben Kovitz]]

''I'm an ENTP, so I don't think the Domninant Function switching theory holds. But I do agree with your joke! Last week I watched Bowling for Columbine with an INTJ. When the film ended I was all ready to discuss all the connections Michael Moore had made, evaluate them, expand upon them. Before I could get a word out, however, the INTJ started an angry tirade about how the whole thing was a huge fakery, crawling with bias, Moore a liar, etc.''

''I've seen ENTJs in similar situations, where they don't agree with something presented. They might get similarly worked up, but when pressed they have a line of reasoning ready which you can be persuaded to or argue against. INTJs cross their arms and say they ''know'' something's not right. They don't know how nor what exactly isn't right, but they KNOW it! My response to that is, how do you expect me to believe you if you can't explain yourself?''
