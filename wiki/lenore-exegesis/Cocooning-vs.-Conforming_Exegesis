This might be what [[Lenore Thomson]] means by ''[[extraversion]]'' and ''[[introversion]]'' (as attitudes that people can take, not as personality types).

----

To "introvert" means to build and occupy a "cocoon": a set-up where you are in control and where the environment is highly adapted to you.  For example, learning a skill and taking a job where you get to apply that skill relentlessly.  Or having a private art studio where you get to make art your own way, without regard to sales or critics (Ji).  Or working in a library where you can explore and gather facts at your own pace, without regard to whether other people find those facts interesting or even whether you'll have any use for them (Pi).

To "extravert" means to conform yourself to reality as it exists right now: to shape yourself to fit the reality.  For example, if your culture views blonde hair as attractive, you might dye your hair blonde in order to fit in (Se).  Or if there is a good deal available on something right now, you take it even if you're not sure how you can use that thing: you have to take opportunities when they come, not when you plan for them to come (Ne).  Or if people are using certain kinds of concepts and conventions to frame agreements, then you make offers and counteroffers for your own best advantage in terms of those same concepts and conventions (Te).  Or if your culture defines giving a gift as an overture of friendliness, then you give gifts to keep people friendly (Fe).

This might be the broadest sense in which [[Lenore]] uses the terms ''[[extraversion]]'' and ''[[introversion]]''.  They point out a biological distinction inherent in all living things, not just people or consciousness.  A living thing is continuously adapting itself to its environment: reshaping itself to exploit what's available and expand into whatever space its environment provides.  But if that's all a living thing did, it wouldn't be alive, it would be a gas.  Something else that living things do is rework the materials of their environment into a form that matches their inner plan.  A tomato plant converts molecules in its surroundings into leaves and tomatoes.  A snail converts molecules in its surroundings into a shell where the snail can be safe and thrive.  Every living thing constantly balances these opposing pulls: the extraverted need to expand and conform, and the introverted need to bring forth a certain inner plan regardless of one's circumstances.

Some living things tend to be oriented more by one pull than the other, hence the [[Extraverted]]/[[Introverted]] distinction.

= Losing and regaining balance =

Seen this way, life is a continuous process of maintaining a balance between [[extraverted]] and [[introverted]] needs.  We get out of balance one way, we restore the balance, we get out balance another way, we restore the balance, and so on until we die.  There is never any ultimate, perfect state to reach, there is only the process of losing and regaining balance.

== Going too far in the [[extraverted]] direction ==

Te: turning life into such a bottom-line rule-driven activity that the actual needs of life get forgotten.  You "win" by the rules of the game you've defined, but the win is hollow, unsatisfying, and perhaps even destructive.  For example, "winning" at business in a way that adds up to a lot of money in the bank but you're making a rotten product, you've squeezed out competitors who had better things to offer, your employees are miserable, and even your customers are miserable--they just can't do anything about it because your market position and government support are so solid.

Fe: keeping yourself liked and keeping everything harmonious, to the point that you become a people-pleaser with no soul of your own.  You lose touch with your own desires, your own ability to see and judge for yourself.  Every decision becomes a political calculation: "Where will this make me stand in other people's eyes?"

Se: conforming so completely to cultural standards of attractivess or attention-getting that all you end up with is unsatisfying hedonism.  Like in a W.C. Fields movie, every moment is disconnected from every other; there's no coherence, no connection between things, and no meaning or satisfaction.  All you've got is the ability to make a good impression.  And even that wears thin after a while, as people sense your own emptiness, like there's not a person inside, just an image and some knee-jerk reactions.

Ne: destabilizing things so much, pouncing on every new possibility so much, that nothing can actually develop.  The minute you make progress in one direction, you change course because some other opportunity catches your eye.  Eventually you wear away the accumulated capital that's needed to support speculative and uncertain ventures.  There comes a point where improvisation no longer works, because there's no margin for error and you can't stack the deck anymore.

== Going too far in the [[introverted]] direction ==

Ti: pushing elegance and "tight" harmony of things so far that all other factors and aspects of life get out of balance.  You make an absolutely perfect design, work of art, theory, or whatever, but it's late and it neglects things that other people need in order to find it valuable.  You pushed one factor all the way, but actually a great many factors are needed to make something successful in the real world, including the factors of "comprehensible to others" and "desirable to others". 

Fi: being so concerned with doing right for every living thing that you fail to do right by yourself.  Your own negotiating position becomes weak because you have nothing to offer but appealing to mercy.  You and everyone around you is in desperate need, not because of "the system" but because you let yourself get into that position.  When weakness becomes a point of pride, not something to heal, then your values are no longer in sync with life.

Si: holding certain things so well protected that you choke off the adaptability of the system that you're in.  For example, making your procedures very, very, very complicated, to be sure of addressing every single possible thing that could go wrong--and ending up with procedures so complicated that you can't capitalize on opportunities, can't get things done in a reasonable amount of time, and can't address the truly unpredictable except by setting up barricades to keep it out.

Ni: seeing through everything to the point where you can't see anything.

== [[Developing the secondary ]] ==

When things get out of balance, it's tempting to restore the balance by going to the opposite function.  Perhaps the rule-driven Te who's taken definable success to the point that it's choking the life out of things could fix matters by taking on some of that unconditional Fi benevolence.

But it doesn't work that way, because J and P ways of approaching life are much harder to get into balance than E and I approaches.  The [[secondary function]] provides a way to restore the balance without massively jettisoning your whole life and prior investments.

For [[EJs]], [[introverted perception]] provides a symbol- and sign-driven way to see the many parts of reality that fall between the cracks of one's existing criteria of success and self-definition.

For [[EPs]], [[introverted judgement]] provides a reality-driven, gut-level way to see connection between things and thereby see and value coherence in one's life.

For [[IPs]], [[extraverted perception]] provides a reality-driven, gut-level way to take into account unpredictable and unexpected factors and find a path that is successful in the here and now.

For [[IJs]], [[extraverted judgement]] provides a symbol- and sign-driven way to plot a course and choose which factors to neglect in order to accomplish something tangible here and now.

After all you've done, why do so many people think they'd be better off if you were out of the picture?

== Introverts and extraverts in private and public ==

The above would explain a common observation about introverts: they usually have no idea what to say in a group conversation or upon meeting a stranger, but one-on-one with people they know well, they usually talk openly, loudly, and at great length.  This would be classic introversion, not just the quietness among strangers but also the openness and richness that emerges in private.  The tendency to become truly oneself only in specially controlled and filtered circumstances is the definition of introversion proposed here.

Some introverts say that they're "extraverted" with people they know, but that's just using the word "extraverted" to mean something else.  The idea proposed here is that when [[Lenore]] says "extraverted", she means the attitude of shaping yourself to your surroundings and what is do-able here and now--not the introverted style of allowing yourself to come forth openly only among people with whom you've established a great deal of common rapport and shared understanding.  An introverted attitude is to require a "cocoon" in order to freely let your spontaneous thoughts and creativity emerge.

The same phenomenon is in action among performers who are open and outrageous on stage, but private and quiet during everyday life, especially when interacting with strangers or in groups.  The stage, even though it's a public performance, is still a highly controlled place.  By the definition proposed here, these performers are just as introverted when they're being outrageous on stage as when they're being quiet in a group setting.  The introversion is the need to have a controlled space in order to "come out and be yourself".

The above would also explain a less-common phenomenon: the way extraverts seem to dissolve as you get to know them.  In public, in a group setting, the extravert has something to react against, something to give instant feedback right now.  ''Not'' being in control, having to respond right now to action and stimulation that comes from outside, is what triggers an extravert to let himself loose and truly be himself.  It's only in response to the outside world that an extravert's personality spontaneously takes shape.  When you get an extreme extravert in a one-on-one situation that calls for a self to emerge mostly out of his inner nature, then it's the extravert who is tongue-tied.  Without something external to react to, what is there to say?  Without something truly outside himself to provoke him and stimulate him and react visibly to him, what is there to do?  How could anything matter?

Introverts who marry or try to make close friends with extraverts often find themselves disappointed.  What seemed at first like an amazingly clear and definite person, the introvert eventually starts to see as diffuse and empty.  In the "cocoon" setting that the introvert prefers, the extravert seems soulless and to have nothing inside to bring to the conversation.  By the definition proposed here, the diffuseness and "uhh...nothing to say" that shows up in private or in-depth settings is no less a manifestation of extraversion than the spontaneity and clarity that emerges when dealing with a group of strangers.
