''Psychological Types'' is a [[book http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691018138/greenlightwik-20]] by [[Carl Jung]].  In ''Psychological Types,'' Jung proposed the basic distinction between [[Extraversion]] and [[Introversion]], and further proposed that there are four [[Functions]] through which we have conscious experience, each capable of being directed in an [[Extraverted]] or [[Introverted]] way.

Jung proposed eight [[Psychological Types]], each with a different [[Dominant Function]]:

Four "rational types":

 An [[Extraverted Thinking]] type.
 An [[Introverted Thinking]] type.
 An [[Extraverted Feeling]] type.
 An [[Introverted Feeling]] type.

Four "irrational types":

 An [[Extraverted Sensation]] type.
 An [[Introverted Sensation]] type.
 An [[Extraverted Intuition]] type.
 An [[Introverted Intuition]] type.

How much commonality is there between [[Lenore Thomson]]'s stuff and [[Carl Jung]]'s?  That's an open question and a great topic for posting to this [[wiki http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis]].
