Cause and effect. Because of this aspect of this animal bone, the animal itself must have been this way.  Introverted thinking is filled with retractions, clauses, etc....  Extroverted thinking is not.  My dad is an ETJ (think Terry Pratchett, Bill Nye the Science Guy, MacGyver, Julian Barbour, Michael Medved vs. Peter Lynds, Xeno, Nietzsche), I recognize the difference.

Note: If you're going to edit this out, please add it to the cuvier section. Deduction vs Induction: It's quite possible I'm using the wrong words.  Hopefully my intended meaning is clear.

From a judging perspective, the only value in Keirsey is his categories and descriptions of communication and orientation.  Trying to collate his types to Jungs base types is difficult (he lists Camille Paglia, an ESTJ, as an ENTP -- and seems to base his description of ENTP on what Jung would have called ESTJ).
