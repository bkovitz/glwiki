'''A definition'''

[[Extraverted Intuition]] (Ni) is the attitude that what is manifest (apparent, observable) is a reflection of a greater reality.  The dinosaur bone hints at the dinosaur, the cloud hints at the coming thunderstorm, the thunderstorm is a reflection of the rotation of the Earth within its atmosphere.  Whatever you find, there is something more to find: a broader context, a whole, which will change your understanding of the part.

[[Extraverted Intuition]] (Ne) is the attitude that the unknown is filled with wonderful things.  To make use of them, you must be flexible in your goals.  If you try to set things up so that only something known to be good can happen, you close your eyes to the zillions of opportunities for things that are good in ways that you don't currently know.  As more of the unknown becomes clear, the more it changes your understanding of the (currently) known.

To live, then, you need to continuously welcome the unknown, by always being ready to adjust in unanticipatable ways.  What seems like a mistake is not a mistake when viewed in a larger pattern--and it's your job to find that larger pattern.

(Compare [[Introverted Sensation]], which leads to the exact opposite attitude toward the unknown.  Ne says to anchor yourself nowhere, so you can continuously adapt to exploit unknown opportunities; Si says to anchor yourself firmly to what matters regardless of change, in order to keep out the unknown and its attendant, unknowable risks.)
