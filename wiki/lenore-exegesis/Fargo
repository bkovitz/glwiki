Regarding the Coen Bros. movie Fargo, Ben Kovitz wrote:

With one exception, I found the type-guessing fairly difficult in
this movie.

The one exception was Marge Gunderson, the pregnant police chief who
singlehandedly brought in all the bad guys while keeping her
husband's spirits up about his painting and always maintaining her
own cheerful demeanor.  ESTJ.  To relate her to Lenore-attitudes,
her approach was completely deductive and fact-oriented.  But to
relate her to Lenore-attitudes much more, she continually put her
feelings aside for the sake of her responsibilities as wife and
police chief.  A classic Lenorean E__J.  When Jerry Lundegaard (ack,
I'm not sure of the spelling!) refused to cooperate, she knew
exactly what her socially defined powers were and exercised them
without hesitation.  She knew exactly who to talk to, what the
official rules were, and how to call upon the official rules for the
sake of her duty to the community.  All very dom-Te.  She was
extraordinarily anchored in facts gathered impersonally--all very
STJ.  But she showed almost no private interests or curiosities or
world of her own, despite the factual orientation.  Very
secondary-Si.  We even see some healthy tertiary Ne (ENFP-style) in
the way she finds out-of-the-box reasons to give her husband hope
about his painting, e.g. lots of people have to buy small stamps
when they raise postage rates.


Jerry Lundegaard: INTP.  Clearly this is not a guy whose sense of
himself is rooted in community or relationship.  Nor, in a classic
I__P fashion, does he have any particular sense of who he is.  He's
sort of following along, irritated that his socially defined
relationships (Fe) don't bring him anything he likes, but not sure
what else he can do.  Ne seems to show up in the way he frequently
buys time by finding some new way to complicate the situation by
bringing in some new factor.  He'a also trying to orchestrate every
variable of the kidnapping, which fits the way Lenore describes Ti.
In fact, it seems clear that this sort of subtle orchestration of
lots of variables is his main modus vivendi.  He doesn't show a
solid Ne sense of extraverted stake in things, though, because he
isn't finding ways to take what comes and change its meaning by
adding surprising external elements.  He is using Ne adaptation to
try to control his situation.


The quiet kidnapper: ISFP.  This is mostly a gut read.  He seems
completely anchored in his own sense of what is pleasurable.  While
he's not possessive, he has that Fi kind of selfishness--a sort of
obliviousness to much else beyond what strikes him as immediately
enjoyable.  His extraordinary muteness also seems to be a common
ISFP trait.  He has the utter realism of an Se attitude.  Perhaps
his strange imperviousness to anyone else's thoughts or opinions
results from tertiary Ni.  Another way his ISFP-ishness might show
up is the way he got hooked by soap operas.  Soap operas seem to me
a very ISFP-oriented art form, filled with simple clashes between
people each striving to fulfill themselves.  The conflicts mostly
center on the characters' personal relationships and their need to
be seen as attractive.  Each scene goes like this: someone says
something that makes someone else feel good or feel bad.  Ooooh!
How will that person respond?  And back and forth it goes, these
sorts of exchanges being seen as the stuff of life.


Shep Proudfoot: ISFP.  Not much to go on here, but he has that ISFP
muteness.  Notice that when he comes to beat up Steve Buscemi, there
is no sense that he is acting in the name of impersonal justice.  He
is acting to protect his own private interests.  He does it not
because it's "right" but because it's *him*.  That in itself doesn't
suggest Fi, but in combination with the clearly IS_P "artisan"
orientation, perhaps it does.  What seems to bother him is not that
Buscemi violated his natural rights, but that Buscemi was such a
clod that it caused Shep trouble.  "I'm out for myself, you're out
for yourself, we're all unique and that's ok, but c'mon, we've got
to find an intelligent way to get along" seems to me to be a typical
SFP attitude.


Steve Buscemi: ISTP.  Notice the Ti appeal to what makes sense over
the rules in his encounters with parking-lot attendants.  Notice
also the inferior-Fe-ish claims to obligations owed him by
others--obligations that no one else recognizes.  He's another
orchestrator.  Some arguments for an Se attitude are what seems to
be a strong desire to appear "cool", his need for constant action,
his need to make a strong impact on whoever he meets, and his
appetite for high-intensity sex.  If Se is right, his need for
control would make him an ISTP.  Clearly he tries to rule each
situation with logic.  He sort of wants logic to prevail, though
it's his own idiosyncratic understanding of logic.  "You fuckin'
shot me!"  How dare the father bring a gun to defend his daughter
and his money.  Notice the complete lack of empathy.  Notice the
appeal to an impersonal sense of justice that he sees as pervading
everything, and why can't these idiots around me see that and go
along with it?  There is a way that things are supposed to go, and
this ain't it.


Wade (Jerry's father-in-law): ESTP.  Very canny, analytical (Ti),
but utterly realistic and pragmatic in that dom-Se way.  Oriented to
the visible status-oriented things that his culture has defined: the
wealth, the power, the clothes, the car, etc.  Trusts and acts on
his instinctive reactions in that SP way.


Jerry's wife: ISFJ.  Stereotypical.



Was there a theme to this movie?  "Kidnapping and murder in
SJ-land"?  "This is what happens when you fuck a loved one in the
ass"?

''ISTP doesn't seem right to me (but neither does any type) for Steve, but here's an semi-supportive observation: during the rather unconvincing sex scene when Steve protests to Shep, "Hey, I'm banging this chick!", I had a flashback to the Dude's "Careful, man, there's a beverage involved here" (something like that) in The Big Lebowski.  The humor in both is how utterly irrelevant honoring the victim's little environment is to their aggressors.  This suggests introversion (and maybe Ti) as Ben characterized it in TBL, but I'm still leaning toward Steve maybe being a rather sick and ineffectual ENTJ.  As opposed to a sick but effective ENTJ like Walter.''

Actually, I've also been thinking ENTJ for the Steve Buscemi character as another hypothesis.  He's utterly inconsiderate, steamrollering over anything that doesn't meet his criteria of how things should be.  When he meets a situation that requires him to look at things differently, he responds by calling upon gut-level responses to show his anger without regard for consequence or social appropriateness, which would be tertiary or even inferior Se.  --[[Ben Kovitz]]

Appealing to mercy is surely about as un-Te as you can possibly get.  The bottom line is the deal, and each partner's negotiating position ''right now''.  A bloody jaw is not an appeal to someone's self-interest.  From a Te perspective, the fact that he is injured is no claim on anyone else.  Any serious ETJ could tell you that.  From a Te perspective, your difficulties, whether self-made or not your fault, are perhaps a basis for charity but not a negotiating position that anyone needs to take seriously.

Perhaps what's happened is that both kidnappers were caught in an inability to harmonize dominant and inferior functions.  At the end, the ISFP kidnapper kills his partner with an air of, "Nothing personal but I have to kill you." ([[Joe Butt]] uses that line to illustrate ENTJs.)  The ENTJ kidnapper who's been taking anything he wants because he wants it, viewing everyone else as hopelessly illogical, gets himself killed by appealing to mercy...to an ISFP who can't give it.
